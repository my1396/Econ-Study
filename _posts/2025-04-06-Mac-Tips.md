## Font

Q: How to check what font a website uses?  
A: Use the Develop > Show Web Inspector (⌥⌘I), and search in the page's source code, "font-family". 

Tips: you can use cursor to inspect an element. 
<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1yX6s1ONncYm969FtlEno--nqeW1cmAU3&sz=w1000" alt="Web inspector" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" /> 
The source code of the selected element will be highlighted.

- The `font-family` is under the `Computed` tab.
- You can inspect the url or an image using this way.

**Download and install a font**

[**Download Mac system fonts**](https://support.apple.com/guide/font-book/install-and-validate-fonts-fntbk1000/mac)

- System fonts you can download show a download button  in the Font Book app <img src="https://help.apple.com/assets/65D69D493593D0EF840ADCFB/65D69D4A5BC27E542105EC4C/en_US/c919e2741b3563b2fbc6519a0615f1d4.png" alt="" height="30" width="30" originalimagename="SharedGlobalArt/AppIconTopic_FontBook.png">.
- To install, do any of the following 
  - In the Font Book app, choose File > Add Fonts to Current User. In the window that appears, double-click the font file.
  - Drag the font file to the Font Book app icon in the Dock, then click Install in the dialog that appears.
  - Double-click the font file in the Finder, then click Install in the dialog that appears.



[**Install other fonts**](https://support.apple.com/guide/font-book/install-and-validate-fonts-fntbk1000/mac)

1. Download the font file.

    Note: macOS supports 

    - TrueType (`.ttf`), Variable TrueType (`.ttf`), TrueType Collection (`.ttc`), 
    - OpenType and OpenType-SVG (`.otf`), and 
    - OpenType Collection (`.ttc`) fonts. 
    - Legacy suitcase TrueType fonts and PostScript Type 1 LWFN fonts might work but aren’t recommended.
    
    See the differences in these font files [HERE](https://www.whitepeakdigital.com/blog/font-file-types-explained/).
    
    Choose where to install fonts:
    
    - *Current User:* Fonts are available only to you and are located in the Fonts folder in your home Library (`~/Library/Fonts/`). 
    - *All Users:* Fonts are available to any user on this Mac and are located in the Fonts folder in the system Library (`/Library/Fonts/`). 
2. In the Font Book app , choose File > Add Fonts to Current User. In the window that appears, double-click the font file.

    When you’re installing fonts, Font Book lists any problems it finds for you to review. Font Book also checks for duplicate fonts.

When you install a font, there are typeface variations, such as, regular, bold, and italics.

A single font file contains only one font with one style (one of normal/oblique/italic) and one weight (one of normal/bold).

You do NOT need to install them all, only the ones you plan to use.

> The full DejaVu fonts family contains following styles:
>
> - Sans: Book, Bold, Oblique, Bold Oblique, Condensed, Condensed Bold, Condensed Oblique and Condensed Bold Oblique, Extralight
> - Serif: Book, Bold, Italic, Bold Italic, Condensed, Condensed Bold, Condensed Italic and Condensed Bold Italic
> - Mono: Book, Bold, Oblique, Bold Oblique

**Install the non-free MS Office fonts**

It is possible to install the non-free MS Office fonts, which came with Office 2007 and Windows 7. Notably, this collection includes Calibri and Cambria, default fonts used in many MS Office documents.

Here we install the fonts available in the Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer (ppviewerFonts).

1. Download the Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer executable:

    ```bash
    # download with `wget`
    wget https://archive.org/download/PowerPointViewer_201801/PowerPointViewer.exe
    # or with `curl`
    curl -O http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/5/a/f5a3df76-d856-4a61-a6bd-722f52a5be26/PowerPointViewer.exe
    ```

    Verify that it is the correct file:

    ```
    sha256sum PowerPointViewer.exe
    ```

    If the checksum doesn't match `249473568eba7a1e4f95498acba594e0f42e6581add4dead70c1dfb908a09423`, then it's not the right file.  You can also save [PowerPointViewer.exe.sha256](https://wiki.debian.org/ppviewerFonts?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=PowerPointViewer.exe.sha256) in the same directory and verify the checksum automatically with: 

    ```
    sha256sum -c PowerPointViewer.exe.sha256
    ```

    which should return `PowerPointViewer.exe: OK`. 

2. Extract the font installer.

    You need a tool to extract the files from the executable. It may be possible to use `unrar`, but `cabextract` is a better match for this use-case.

    Install `cabextract` if you don't have it.

    ```bash
    brew install cabextract
    ```

    Extract the part of the installer (`ppviewer.cab`) that has the fonts:

    ```
    cabextract PowerPointViewer.exe -F ppviewer.cab
    ```
    
3. Extract the font files (i.e., `.ttf`, `.ttc`) into your user's font directory and install fonts.

    - If you just want to install <u>a specific font</u>:

        ```bash
        # create a folder to extract font files
        mkdir -p /Users/menghan/Documents/PhD\ Courses/mac_setup/fonts/ppviewer
        # `-d` specifies the directory, otherwise will extract to the current folder, which is messy.
        cabextract ppviewer.cab -d /Users/menghan/Documents/PhD\ Courses/mac_setup/fonts/ppviewer
        ```

        Consolas is aimed for use in programming environments and other circumstances where a monospaced font is specified. It has four font styles:

        | File name      | Styles & Weights     |
        | -------------- | -------------------- |
        | `CONSOLA.TTF`  | Consolas Regular     |
        | `CONSOLAB.TTF` | Consolas Bold        |
        | `CONSOLAZ.TTF` | Consolas Bold Italic |
        | `CONSOLAI.TTF` | Consolas Italic      |
    
        Two options you can install the fonts:
    
        - use `open` CLT or 
    
          ```bash
          # install `consola` font family 
          open CONSOLA*.TTF
          ```
    
          A dialog shows, press `Intall` font. You will install four font styles (regular, italic, bold, bold italic) at once.
    
          <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1meTpGztYVppfqengkcntmWbQp1iAl9xc&sz=w1000" alt="Consolas font" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:40%;" />
    
        - double-click and install with the Font Book app <img src="https://help.apple.com/assets/65D69D493593D0EF840ADCFB/65D69D4A5BC27E542105EC4C/en_US/c919e2741b3563b2fbc6519a0615f1d4.png" alt="" height="30" width="30" originalimagename="SharedGlobalArt/AppIconTopic_FontBook.png">
    
          The app allows a preview of the font you are installing, and it validate fonts to make sure no errors or no duplicate fonts are installed.
    
          Select multiple files and double-click will open all styles at once. Otherwise, you need to install per style separately.
    
        When you finish installing, the Font Book will show your fonts.
    
        <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1LIfjRoII2g65UqIwEPRRcaYzJqp_kula&sz=w1000" alt="Font Book" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />
    
        Click the `Details` tab, you can see where the font is installed. For me, it's `/Users/menghan/Library/Fonts/CONSOLA*.TTF`. Meaning the font is installed for the *current user*.
    
    - If you want to install <u>all fonts</u> contained in the installer:
    
        Deprecated `~/.fonts`:
        ```
        mkdir -p ~/.fonts/ppviewer/
        cabextract ppviewer.cab -F '*.TTC' -d ~/.fonts/ppviewer/
        cabextract ppviewer.cab -F '*.TTF' -d ~/.fonts/ppviewer/
        ```
    
        In favor of the [XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg-base], `~/.local/share/fonts`. 
    
        Unless you're using a legacy application that doesn't recognize the newer XDG spec, it's recommended to use that instead of `~/.fonts`:
    
        ```bash
        mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts/ppviewer/
        cabextract ppviewer.cab -F '*.TTC' -d ~/.local/share/fonts/ppviewer/
        cabextract ppviewer.cab -F '*.TTF' -d ~/.local/share/fonts/ppviewer/
        ```
    
        After this step, you may delete `PowerPointViewer.exe` and `ppviewer.cab`.
    
        If your font-using application is already open, it'll probably need to be restarted before it can use the newly-installed fonts.

Q: Why Consolas (code font) look smaller than Verdana (body text fonts) even for the same font size? See below. The first line is in Verdana and the second is Consolas. Both 12pt. Consolas is slightly shorter.

<img src="https://i.sstatic.net/yNg0K.png" alt="Font Size" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:100%;" />

A: Consolas has a smaller x-height than Verdana. This is a font design issue. 

Tip: The solution is to use matching fonts. 

- If you really want to use Verdana for copy text, Lucida Console is probably the best choice for a monospace font. 
- If you want to use Consolas as monospace font (fine!), then use another “C font” for copy text, such as Cambria (serif font) or Calibri or Candara (sans-serif fonts).
