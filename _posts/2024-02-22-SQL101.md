**Comments**

Single line comments start with `--`

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.



## Select

Full syntax

```sql
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT ]
[ TOP (top_value) [ PERCENT ] [ WITH TIES ] ]
expressions
FROM tables
[WHERE conditions]
[GROUP BY expressions]
[HAVING condition]
[ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC ]];
```



- `WHERE` to filter which rows to subset



Return all rows and all columns

```sql
SELECT *  
FROM DimEmployee  
ORDER BY LastName; 
```

`*` to subset all columns



Selected columns and all rows

- Each column is separated by a comma.

```sql
SELECT BusinessEntityID, FirstName, LastName, ModifiedDate
FROM [Person].[Person]
```



Q: Why do we use square brackets?

A: They come in handy if the names of your columns or tables coincide with <u>reserved SQL keywords</u> or <u>contain spaces or hyphens</u>. 

```sql
-- an example why brackets [] are important
SELECT *
FROM [My Table]      -- Identifier contains a space and uses a reserved keyword.
WHERE [order] = 10   -- Identifier is a reserved keyword.
```



Q: What does `[Person].[Person]` mean?

A: `[SchemaName].[TableName] `.

Selected columns and top 10 rows

This is useful for previewing a table with a large number of rows.

```sql
SELECT TOP(10)
     [BusinessEntityID]
    ,[FirstName]
    ,[LastName]
    ,[ModifiedDate]
FROM [Person].[Person]
```





Using table aliasing

```sql
SELECT e.*  
FROM DimEmployee AS e  
ORDER BY LastName;  
```

Rename a column

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, StartDate AS FirstDay  
FROM DimEmployee   
ORDER BY LastName; 
```

New column based on one existing column

```sql
SELECT FirstName, LastName, BaseRate, BaseRate * 40 AS GrossPay  
FROM DimEmployee  
ORDER BY LastName;  
```

Unique values in one column

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Title  
FROM DimEmployee  
ORDER BY Title;  
```

Save the query result into a new table

```sql
SELECT * INTO CustomersGermany
FROM Customers
```

Select from multiple tables

```sql
SELECT inventory.inventory_id, products.product_name, inventory.quantity
FROM inventory
INNER JOIN products
ON inventory.product_id = products.product_id
ORDER BY inventory_id;
```



Filter rows based on values in one column

Return all rows from the *employees* table where the *last_name* is either 'Smith', 'Anderson', or 'Johnson'. 

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
		WHERE last_name IN ('Smith', 'Anderson', 'Johnson');
```

Because the `*` is used in the SELECT, all fields from the *employees* table would appear in the result set.

Note that: single quotes `'Smith'`are used for matched strings. Double quotes are used for columns names or table names.

For instance

```sql
select "first_name" from "employees";
```

where first_Name is a **column name** from **employees** table.

The above IN example is equivalent to the following SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
    WHERE last_name = 'Smith'
    OR last_name = 'Anderson'
    OR last_name = 'Johnson';
```



## String

`LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `SUBSTRING`

- `LEFT(string, number_of_chars)` subset a number of characters from left
- `RIGHT(string, number_of_chars)` subset a number of characters from right
- `SUBSTRING(string, start, length)` subset from a middle position indexed at `start`



`CHARINDEX(substring, string, start)`  searches for a substring in a string, and returns the position.

- `start` 	the postion where the search will start. The 1st position in string is 1.



Subset before a symbol

- `LEFT(field_name, CHARINDEX('symbol needed', field_name) - 1)`

  ```sql
  -- extract from the left to the hypen symbol (`-`)
  SELECT  
  LEFT(identifier,CHARINDEX('-', identifier) - 1) AS identifier
  FROM table_4
  -- extract from the left to the space (` `)
  SELECT  
  LEFT(identifier,CHARINDEX(' ', identifier) - 1) AS identifier
  FROM table_5
  ```


Subset after a symbol

- `RIGHT(field_name, CHARINDEX('symbol needed', (REVERSE(field_name))) - 1)`

  use `REVERSE` to get the position starting from the right.



**Wildcards**

Use `LIKE pattern` to match a specific pattern, rather than one exact value.

| Wildcard character     | Description                                                  | Example                                                      |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `%` or `*`             | Any string of zero or more characters.                       | `WHERE title LIKE '%computer%'` finds all book titles with the word `computer` anywhere in the book title. |
| `_`(underscore) or `?` | Any single character.                                        | `WHERE au_fname LIKE '_ean'` finds all four-letter first names that end with `ean` (`Dean`, `Sean`, and so on). |
| `[ ]`                  | Any single character within the specified range `[a-f]` or set `[abcdef]`. | `WHERE au_lname LIKE '[C-P]arsen'` finds author last names ending with `arsen` and starting with any single character between `C` and `P`, for example `Carsen`, `Larsen`, `Karsen`, and so on. In range searches, the characters included in the range may vary depending on the sorting rules of the collation. |
| `[^]`                  | Any single character **not** within the specified range `[^a-f]` or set `[^abcdef]`. | `WHERE au_lname LIKE 'de[^l]%'` finds all author last names starting with `de` and where the following letter isn't `l`. |

- Escape a wildcard character: enclose with `[]`. 





**Print column names**

```sql
-- print all column names
SELECT * 
FROM sys.columns 
WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID('sym_v1.sym_coverage')
```
