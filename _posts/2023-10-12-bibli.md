title: Add Bibliography Using Jekyll Plugin

Use [`Jekyll-Scholar`](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) plugin to enable citation and add bibliography.

Github Pages doesn't support the plugin. Two options provide a workaround:

- Change between two branches of your site repository.

  - Build your site locally and push the results to the `source` branch. This is where you keep your entire project, e.g., sources, configuration and plugins, where you make changes and build your site locally. 
    - `_site` folder should be in the `.gitignore`. It contains Jekyll compiled HTML fies. Once build (locally), these files can be uploaded directly to a server, e.g., GitHub Pages, for hosting.

  -  `master` or `gh-pages` branch. This is where GitHub Pages are deployed. Consists solely of the compiled sites which GitHub Pages can use directly.
    - Create a `_nojekyll` file to tell GitHub Pages not to run Jekyll each time you push things. This is very important if you have directories beginning with `_` since they have a special treatment with Jekyll (they are not deployed on the Web site).
    - Meanwhile, in the `_config.yml` of the `source` branch, under the `include` key, we need to add `- .nojekyll`.

  - Note: It is recommended to change your default branch to `source`. Optionally, you can make the `source` branch protected to prevent it from being accidently deleted or overriden.

- Alternatively, you can use a [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) called [jekyll-action](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action) to deploy your site to Github Pages.

  > This saves you time to manage different branches every time you make a change in your repo.
  >
  > Building and deployment is done through Github Actions automatically. I would **recommend** this approach.

### Installation

In `Gemfile`, add `gem 'jekyll-scholar'` .

Create a `_bibliography` directory to sotre your bibliography `.bib` files. The `_` in the directory name means that Jekyll will not copy it in the generated site (`_site` by default). If you want that your bibliography file is visible to your site visitors, then you should take this into account and, e.g., store the file in a `bibliography` directory instead. 

#### 1. Use GitHub Actions to build and deploy GitHub Pages site
For security reasons, only a limited number of [third-party plugins are supported by the GitHub Pages][github-pages-dependencies] automated build pipeline using the default ```'Deploy from a branch'``` method. It is possible, however, to use GitHub's continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform, [Github Actions][github-actions], and [create a custom workflow][github-actions-github-pages] that installs any jekyll plugin. This is actually very easy to do from your GitHub Pages repository page:  

1. Open the ```Settings```--> ```Pages``` tab 
2. Under ```'Build and Deployment'```, change the ```'Source'``` from ```'Deploy from a branch'``` to ```'GitHub Actions'```
3. Add the suggested workflow yaml file (saved under ```.github/workflows```)

You can see my final workflow file [here][github-workflow].

Note: if you have a ```Gemfile.lock``` file committed to your repo then it may cause issues: add it to ```.gitignore``` and remove it from your git cache (```git rm --cache Gemfile.lock```)

#### 2. Add the jekyll-scholar plugin
This is also straightforward:
1. Add ```gem "jekyll-scholar", group: :jekyll_plugins``` to your ```Gemfile``` (you can see mine [here][gemfile])
2. Add ```- jekyll-scholar``` to your ```_config.yml``` (see mine [here][config])

#### 3. Downgrade ruby
Ideally, the two steps above would be all that is needed to get up and running with jekyll-scholar on GitHub Pages but when I tried adding a citation and building my site locally I got the error message ```Liquid Exception: tried to create Proc object without a block```. 

After a lot of googling I landed on the most likely source of the problem being [incompatible ruby versions][ruby-issue] between [github-pages][github-pages-gems] and jekyll-scholar. I have not spent a lot of time trying to dig into this to figure out why it is an issue, or if there is a better way to solve it, but downgrading ruby from ```3.1.2``` to ```2.7.2``` solved the problem and so this is what I am doing for now.

##### Downgrade ruby locally
1. Install older ruby version locally using [chruby][chruby] (```ruby-install 2.7.2```)
2. Restart your terminal
3. Select older ruby version with ```chruby 2.7.2```
4. Re-run ```bundle install``` to update gems
5. Run ```bundle exec jekyll serve``` to validate fix

##### Downgrade ruby in build pipeline
1. Add a ```.ruby-version``` file to the root of your repo and specify ruby version ```2.7.2```
2. Remove the ruby version line from the ```jekyll.yml``` workflow



### Configuration

you can configure the way Jekyll-Scholar works using your `_config.yml` configuration file. The default is (see [here](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar) for the meaning of the contents):

```css
scholar:
  style: apa
  locale: en

  sort_by: none
  order: ascending

  group_by: none
  group_order: ascending

  source: ./_bibliography
  bibliography: references.bib
  bibliography_template: ""

  replace_strings: true
  join_strings:    true

  use_raw_bibtex_entry: false

  details_dir:    bibliography
  details_layout: bibtex.html
  details_link:   Details

  query: "@*"
```



### Citation

Use the following code to add citation.

{: .text-justify}

{% highlight liquid %}

{% raw %}
{% cite Wallace2018 %}

{% endraw %}

{% endhighlight %}

{: .text-justify}

{% cite Wallace2018 %}



Use this to add bibliography

{: .text-justify}

{% highlight liquid %}

{% raw %}


{% bibliography --cited %}

{% endraw %}

{% endhighlight %}

{: .text-justify}
