[Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)  is an open-source template language created by [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) and written in Ruby. It is the backbone of Shopify themes and is used to load dynamic content on websites. Three main components:

- **Objects** enclosed by double curly braces \{\{ and \}\}; referring to predefined variables as contents on a page.

  For example, {\{ page.title \}\} displays the `page.title` variable. 

- **Tags** define the logic and control flow for templates. Use curly braces {% raw  %} {% ... %} {% endraw %} and percent signs for tags:

  For example:

  {% highlight liquid %} {% raw %} {% if page.show_sidebar %}

  <div class="sidebar">
      sidebar content
  </div>

  {% endif %} {% endraw %} {% endhighlight %}

  This displays the sidebar if the value of the `show_sidebar` page variable is true.

- **Filters** takes in a Liquid object or variable, change its form and output. They are used within double curly braces {% raw  %} {{ ... }} {% endraw %} and [variable assignment](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/variable/) are separated by a pipe character `|`. 

  For example:
  {% highlight liquid %} {% raw  %}  {{ "hi" | capitalize }} {% endraw %} {% endhighlight %} 
  This displays `Hi` instead of `hi`.

**Disqus**

### **Back-to-top float button**

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1bTOHwzhxf33U-7XvZ9WqEIsTCczFNj-6&sz=w1000" alt="image-20230803084657700" style="zoom:90%;" />

For this sticky back-to-top button tutorial, we’ll use three languages: 

- HTML for the markup to create the button
- CSS to style the button and have it match your brand
- JavaScript to make it “work” and define the behaviors of the button

1. Using html, create a button that let users click to scroll to top of your webpage. You can use a button or `font-awesome icons` or style a div to make your scroll-to-top button.

   For examples:

   ```html
   <!-- use word -->
   <button id='scroll-to-top'>up</button>
   <!-- use font-awesome icons -->
   <h3><i class="icon-arrow-up"></i></h3>
   <!-- use up arrow -->
   <a class="top-link" href="#">	↑	</a>  
   ```

   You can include this above html inside `_includes/footer.html`. 

   ```html
   <!-- start custom footer snippets -->
   <button id='scroll-to-top'>up</button>
   <!-- end custom footer snippets -->
   ```

2. Add css style to `/assets/css/style.scss` to style up the botton, e.g, how much padding should be around it, the color.





**Alternatively**, could use other people's well defined code. Maybe too elaborate, easiest to implement directly without any adjustment. Drawback is I don't know how to customize it according to my own aesthetic taste. But it is a most straightforward solution for sure.

```css
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vanilla-back-to-top@7.2.1/dist/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js"></script>
<script>addBackToTop({
  diameter: 56,
  backgroundColor: 'rgb(255, 82, 82)',
  textColor: '#fff'
})</script>
```





**TOC** as a sidebar on gh-pages

**Sorting Order of Posts**

Frontpage (index page) sorts by `modified_date` if a post has it, and otherwise it should sort by `date`.



### Relative Links

https://github.blog/2016-12-05-relative-links-for-github-pages/

If you have a Markdown file in your repository at `docs/page.md`, and you want to link from that file to `docs/another-page.md`, you can do so with the following markup:

```scss
[a relative link](another-page.md)
```

When you view the source file on GitHub.com, the relative link will continue to work, as it has before, but now, when you publish that file using GitHub Pages, the link will be silently translated to `docs/another-page.html` to match the target page’s published URL.



**Embed images using relative path**

`<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/image-20230730113759915.png" alt="quadrant geometry" style="zoom:50%;" />`



`baseurl` is set in the `_config.yml`, it is the name of sub-directory the site is served from. E.g., `https://my1396.github.io/Econ-Study/2023/10/03/HTML.html`, 

- url is `https://my1396.github.io`; 
- baseurl is `/Econ-Study`; 
- page url is `/2023/10/03/HTML.html`.



### Link to Google Drive Images

<https://www.intodeeplearning.com/embedding-images-in-google-drive-to-markdown/>

Set **Restricted** mode of sharing to **Anyone with the link**.

For example:

- my link: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L07w0_Qg9q-0Ukm4-K3i8ffyk34FqTzA/view?usp=sharing`
- \<ID of image\> is after `d` and before `view?usp=sharing`, i.e., `1L07w0_Qg9q-0Ukm4-K3i8ffyk34FqTzA` in this case.
- my embeddinwg link: `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1L07w0_Qg9q-0Ukm4-K3i8ffyk34FqTzA`

To embed an image using markdown, use the following:

```markdown
![Example Image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1bXzYeegauqB2M6-VZwitEeXHmMiYZIUY)
```

Add some adjustment

```html
<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-CMHtcl4dcjjA9aWoqiThd2OCznm25rb" alt="image-20210520120254672" style="zoom:50%;" />

<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1bXzYeegauqB2M6-VZwitEeXHmMiYZIUY"
     alt="sample image"
     style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; width: 90%;
     box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)" />
```

Notes: 

- It is fatest to load images when the files are on GitHub. But when you need to upload lots of images, GitHub won't process a large amount at one time. You need to split the upload into small batches.





**Acronyms and Abbreviations**

Abbreviations can be used with an inline abbr and an **astrisk** squared bracket colon (`*[ ]:`) definition somewhere else in the document — the end of file is a good location for this. E.g.

[apa][apa-csl] 

[apa-csl]: https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/apa.csl





[Uploading assets](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#uploading-assets)

You can upload assets like images by dragging and dropping, selecting from a file browser, or pasting. You can upload assets to issues, pull requests, comments, and `.md` files in your repository.

- When you drag and drop, the "Write" box will generate a link for the file.

- Click "Preview" to see if the image shows alright.
