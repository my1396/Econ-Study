[Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)  is an open-source template language created by [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) and written in Ruby. It is the backbone of Shopify themes and is used to load dynamic content on websites. Three main components:

- **Objects** enclosed by double curly braces \{\{ and \}\}; referring to predefined variables as contents on a page.

  For example, {\{ page.title \}\} displays the `page.title` variable. 

- **Tags** define the logic and control flow for templates. Use curly braces {% raw  %} {% ... %} {% endraw %} and percent signs for tags:

  For example:

  {% highlight liquid %} {% raw %} {% if page.show_sidebar %}

  <div class="sidebar">
      sidebar content
  </div>

  {% endif %} {% endraw %} {% endhighlight %}

  This displays the sidebar if the value of the `show_sidebar` page variable is true.

- **Filters** takes in a Liquid object or variable, change its form and output. They are used within double curly braces {% raw  %} {{} ... }} {% endraw %} and [variable assignment](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/tags/variable/) are separated by a pipe character `|`. 

  For example:

  {% raw  %}  

  {{ "hi" \| capitalize }} 

   {% endraw %} 

  This displays `Hi` instead of `hi`.

**Sorting Order of Posts**

Frontpage (index page) sorts by `modified_date` if a post has it, and otherwise it should sort by `date`.



### Relative Links

https://github.blog/2016-12-05-relative-links-for-github-pages/

If you have a Markdown file in your repository at `docs/page.md`, and you want to link from that file to `docs/another-page.md`, you can do so with the following markup:

```scss
[a relative link](another-page.md)
```

When you view the source file on GitHub.com, the relative link will continue to work, as it has before, but now, when you publish that file using GitHub Pages, the link will be silently translated to `docs/another-page.html` to match the target pageâ€™s published URL.



**Embed images using relative path**

`<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/image-20230730113759915.png" alt="quadrant geometry" style="zoom:50%;" />`



`baseurl` is set in the `_config.yml`, it is the name of sub-directory the site is served from. E.g., `https://my1396.github.io/Econ-Study/2023/10/03/HTML.html`, 

- url is `https://my1396.github.io`; 
- baseurl is `/Econ-Study`; 
- page url is `/2023/10/03/HTML.html`.



**How to embed images in Google Drive to markdown?**

<https://www.intodeeplearning.com/embedding-images-in-google-drive-to-markdown/>

Set **Restricted** mode of sharing to **Anyone with the link**.

For example:

- my link: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L07w0_Qg9q-0Ukm4-K3i8ffyk34FqTzA/view?usp=sharing`
- \<ID of image\> is `1L07w0_Qg9q-0Ukm4-K3i8ffyk34FqTzA`
- my embeddinwg link: `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1L07w0_Qg9q-0Ukm4-K3i8ffyk34FqTzA`

To embed an image using markdown, use the following:

```markdown
![Example Image](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1bXzYeegauqB2M6-VZwitEeXHmMiYZIUY)
```

Add some adjustment

```html
<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-CMHtcl4dcjjA9aWoqiThd2OCznm25rb" alt="image-20210520120254672" style="zoom:50%;" />

<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1bXzYeegauqB2M6-VZwitEeXHmMiYZIUY"
     alt="sample image"
     style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; width: 90%;
     box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19)" />
```
