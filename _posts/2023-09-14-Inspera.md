## Question Sets and Questions

Questions Sets 

- Exams 
  
  Each exam is one Question Set.

- Collections of questions that can be reused across multiple exams.
  
  It's like a question bank, but not organized, <span class="env-orange">very difficult to find questions</span> you want later.


**Structure**

- Level 1 Headings
  - Multiple Choice
  - Open-Ended Questions
- Level 2 Headings
  - Each topic
- Level 3 Headings (Optional)
  - Open-Ended Sub-Questions in a topic

For questions that include sub-questions, use <span class="env-green">letter labels (a, b, c, ...)</span> for each sub-question to maintain clarity and organization.


**Multiple Choice:**

- Questions 1 to 9, add two spaces after the period to keep the numbers and items aligned.
- Questions 10 and above, add one extra space.
- Question groups should be numbered with letters (a, b, c, ...) to keep consistency with Inspera.
  
  - Inspera does <span class="env-orange">NOT</span> add numbering for sub-questions.
  - One benefit of this is <span class="env-green">it won't break the numbering of the main questions</span>. This saves lots of time trying to fix numbering after adding/deleting questions.


**Naming Convention:**

- `01_FIN5005_final_exam_2025Fall.qmd`
- `02_FIN5005_formula_sheet_2025Fall.qmd`

## Tips

- Questions types:

  - Multiple Choice [#(MC): ~40]: save time for marking, but take lots of time to create the questions

  - Open Response [#(OR): ~2]: save time for creating questions (MC takes more time to prepare than OR), but more time to mark, and more room for student argument.

- Save your edits frequently, especially when you insert images or type latex formulas! 

  No auto saving in Inspera.

- Leave Section 1 empty, saving it for the Cover Page.

- It is possible to add several <span style='color:#00CC66'>multiple choices</span> in one question to create a question set with sub-questions. Click `+Insert` to add alternative sets.

  Note that for <span style='color:#00CC66'>open response</span> questions, only one response field is allowed. So one question at a time. 

  It is possible to add a "Stimulus" on the left pane, and questions inn the right pane. The stimuli provides general info applicable to all question. While students scroll through the questions in the right pane, the stimulus remains constantly visible for reference. 

  Different layouts for stimulus and questions are available in "[Section Layout](#section-layout)".

- Create Tables in LatexiT, copy to png, save to loacal. Add table as png pictures. 

  - You can copy and paste tables from <span style='color:#00CC66'>Microsoft Word</span> to Inspera. 

    This feature is convenient as it is easier to edit tables in Word or Excel.

  - Inspera does NOT supoort html syntax; Canvas supports html.





**Appearance Design**

- Could choose for instance, whether to show TOC, hide question titles, ...

- Also could choose `Numbering Scheme` to include section numbers, such as 1.1, 1.2, ...

  <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1oRClV4mqtZ262T3cdGP6lwH-EN26higz&sz=w1000" alt="Inspera Design" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

## Question Scoring 

设定问题分值

原则是每一题分值要小，并且每一个小问需要分别设定分值。这样 sensors 之间给分差异的空间会小。

- Setting maximum marks for manually marked questions

  > The **Maximum marks** defines the highest possible number of marks a grader may give to a candidate answer in the grading tool. When creating a manually marked questions, the author can define the maximum marks.

  <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1Bcr98tYDktkedyIzaK3hN3wIbhFr5FF0&sz=w1000" alt="Score" style="zoom:120%;" />

- Automatically marked questions.

  > In the question's edit mode, click `Marks` tab in the general options setting area ❹.  

  Note that you need to put your cursor around area ❶ to set Marks. If your focus is on the alternatives, there are no options for Marks.

  <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=16hKMydUNmdPsvF8GNlAiuf7RNO4bT6jo&sz=w1000" alt="Inspera" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

  <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1MFhgiXp6SHEvbF1d0FGTsRB6LQRBVeVb&sz=w1000" alt="Score" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />



By clicking on the interaction element (答题框) gives you the specific options for the question type. 

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1syMloAKaWjDQ1zDbuc6EYymvt61pw7Qv&sz=w1000" alt="Inspera" style="zoom:80%;" />

<u>Always set the correct answer as the first alternative</u>. The choices will be randomnized anyway, set the answer as 1st saves some hassle.



Open response questions need to choose <span style='color:#00CC66'>`Essay`</span> type, so that it is possible to type equations in the answer box.





Access to required **software** for a new configuration

- Have to request a new exam configuration. 

- Developing new exam configurations can be a lengthy process, so please submit your request ahead of the deadline if possible. 



**Request for Norsk Exam**

Situation: A student requested that the exam shall be provided in Norwegian for him/her due to reading difficulties.

Answer (from Ellen Sirnes): The student must apply for accommodation of teaching and exam (søke om [tilrettelegging av undervisning og eksamen](https://www.nord.no/student/eksamen/tilrettelegging-ved-eksamen)) beforehand. → But changing the language of a study program they have been admitted to is not something they are entitled to.

1. check whether they have applied for the accommodation → in the case, the student here did not apply for individual accommodation
2. I can easily say no and refer toThe regulation that the student has been admitted to a program with English as the language of instruction.

> De kan søke om tilrettelegging av undervisning og eksamen, men å endre språket på et studieprogram de er tatt opp er ikke noe de utgangspunktet har rett til. Fristen for å søke om tilrettelegging er dessuten gått ut (Tilrettelegging ved eksamen).  Vi har ofte vært fleksible og latt dem velge om de svarer på norsk eller engelsk, så lenge sensuren tillater det (vi ikke har kun engelskspråklige sensorer). Jeg forstår det slik at studenten her ønsker en norsk oversettelse av eksamensoppgaven? Det er opp til deg om du ønsker å gi det, men de har da ikke rett på det. Den må da også gis til alle (siden studenten her ikke har søkt om individuell tilrettelegging). Du kan fint si nei og henvise til forskriften under. Studenten er tatt opp på et program med engelsk som undervisningsspråk.

**Regulation: Language and Form of Norwegian** (refer to the image for reference to the original document)

1. Examination papers are given in the language of instruction of the course, unless otherwise stated in the course description. 

2. Examination questions must be answered in the language of instruction of the course, unless otherwise stated in the course description. 

   If the examination is to be answered in Norwegian, it may also be answered in Swedish or Danish, unless otherwise stated in the course description. If the course description does not require testing in a specific language or a specific Norwegian target form, the candidate may choose which Norwegian target form is used in the answer.

3. Examination papers given in Norwegian shall be in Bokmål or Nynorsk in accordance with the target form chosen by the examination candidates when registering for the examination. Exceptions may be made in accordance with the regulations of 7 July 1987 No. 4148 on the target form of examination papers.

4. Candidates with a mother tongue other than Norwegian, and who have not had an assessment in Norwegian from higher education, may in special cases apply to receive the exam questions and submit their answer in English.

Q: What is `non-marked document` type?

A: The question is used to provide candidates with <span style='color:#00CC66'>information</span>. It is visible to the candidates, but is not counted in the numbering for the questions. The question type Document is presented to the candidates, with an "i" in the upper left corner as well as in the bottom menu. 



Q: What is `non-marked form` type?

A: *Form* is a question type used as a questionnaire, so that the candidates can provide additional data (metadata) that the institution wants to collect. The purpose is mainly to gather information relevant to the submission, such as approval for publication, statements about the content, information about the candidates, etc. 



<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1Vk7YqfA_tn9TRrHS9SuTKQxpPsZwVTVB&sz=w1000" alt="question buttons" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:100%;" />
