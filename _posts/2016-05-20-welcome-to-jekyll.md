You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

## Notation

\$\mathbb{E}_Y\$ and $\mathrm{Var}_Y$ denote expectation over $Y$ and variance over $Y$.

It seems that blackboard bold (`\mathbb`) is often used to denote **sets of numbers**, e.g. $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, ℝ, $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{H}$, $\mathbb{O}$, or a general field $\mathbb{F}$ or $\mathbb{K}$, and in probability to denote expectation of a random variable $\mathbb{E}(X)$ or probability of an event $\mathbb{P}(E)$. Sometimes you see a sphere denoted $\mathbb{S}$ or a torus denoted $\mathbb{T}$. 



Crit pt: critical point.
