**Register vehicle** 

<https://www.vegvesen.no/en/>

Dealer deregisters the vehicle. $\rightarrow$ Buyer confirms Notification of Sale from dealer.

It is the dealer who pays the registration transfer fee, registers the vehicle and obtains number plates before you can use the vehicle. The issue of who takes care of insurance and other matters must be sorted out with the dealer.



## Bompeng Toll

If the Token is not read when passing, the Customer is responsible for the toll incurred on the basis of photographing the number plate when passing the toll station. For vehicles without a valid Agreement, the Operator will demand a toll fee directly from the person registered as the vehicle's owner. 

The customer is responsible for removing the vehicle and thereby deactivating the Chip from the Agreement when selling or disposing of the vehicle.

If you change the chip issuer, you need to terminate the previous aggrement by yourself. The AutoPass system is updated within 24 hours after a new chip aggreement has been entered into.

用 AutoPASS brikke 打8折

**Monthly cap**: Charge maximum 80 passes per calendar month per vehicle associated with the AutoPASS. 



Where to put the tag (Feste bombrikken)

The bomb chip must be fixed at the top of the windscreen, to the right of the mirror, so that it does not obstruct the driver's view. Make sure it is not hidden behind windscreen wipers or similar.

前挡风玻璃顶部，后视镜的右边。确保不被雨刷挡住。



How to attach the toll tag 

1. Clean the windscreen where the new toll tag is to be attached. 
2. Remove the cover paper on one side of the Velcro and attach it to the marked area on the toll tag.  
3. Remove the cover paper on the other side of the Velcro, and press the chip against the windshield for 10 seconds.

## Bilforsikring

保险人是第一方（一般是指保险公司），被保险人是第二方（根据保险合同,其财产利益或人身受保险合同保障,在保险事故发生后,享有保险金请求权的人）。

**Ansvarsforsikring** (Liability insurance, third-party car insurance 第三者责任险)

<u>Mandatory</u> to be allowed to drive on Norwegian roads.

This form of car insurance is not aimed at your own car actually, but rather at yourself, your passengers, and the cars, the property, and the people in other cars that end up in the accident. 主要是为了赔付别人。这种保险**用于赔偿因车主在交通事故中承担责任的受害者，包括人身伤害和财产损失**。 这种保险可以保障车主在交通事故中对第三方造成的人身伤害和财产损失进行赔偿。

If you are alone in the accident with your own car, no costs for repairs will be covered. 

车险分三个档次：

- Delkasko (limited comprehensive): Affordable option, especially when the car is older or has a low value. Fire, Theft, and Windscreen Repair and Road/Tow assistance. This type of insurance is usually taken out for used cars that are more than ten years old.
  - Damage to the car that is your own fault is unfortunately not covered by Delkasko. 自身原因造成的问题不予偿付。

- Kasko (comprehensive): covers damage to your own car connected with a collision, driving off the road etc. 
  - Covers damage cuased to your own responsibility. 由于自身原因产生的问题予以偿付
  - Comprehensive Casco Car Insurance covers also the costs of draining and cleaning your tank if you’ve put in the wrong type of fuel.
  - 一般来说，kasko 档次足够使用。
  
- Kasko pluss / toppkasko / super kasko (fully comprehensive): covers the cost of repairing the engine, clutch or gearbox. 



不仅要买保险，还需要支付 **Trafikk­forsikrings­avgift**，每年3000块。

What is the **Trafikk­forsikrings­avgift**, which is 228kr/md?

> You pay the <u>traffic insurance fee</u> to your insurance company, together with the insurance on your car.
>
> The annual fee was changed to a traffic insurance fee in 2018. It is mandatory to have valid insurance for all registered vehicles. If you do not pay insurance and the traffic insurance fee (annual fee) for your vehicle, you will be charged for each day the vehicle is uninsured.
>
> If you have questions about the traffic insurance fee (annual fee), contact your insurance company. You can also read more about traffic insurance tax on the Traffic Insurance Association's website.



**Gjensidige**

Egenandel (Deductible) 免赔额，就是说在保险公司支付你的索赔之前，你需要先支付这个免赔额。

- Gjensidige Kasko & Pluss 8000 kr; 可以自己选



## Digital driving licence

Make your driving licence available on your mobile phone, and leave your physical licence at home when you drive in Norway.

> A digital driving licence is valid as proof of identity if you are stopped for inspection along the road. You should not expect that it will be accepted as proof of identity in other situations.
>
> If you use your digital driving licence when you are driving, you must ensure that you have enough battery life on your mobile phone to last throughout your drive, and the screen must be readable.

If you are going **abroad**, you still need to bring your physical driving licence.

## 冰上行驶

- 保持合理行驶速度。不要过快，否则刹不住车；不要过慢，否则如果遇到上坡，没有足够动力，上不去。
  - 过弯提前减速。
- 不要过度靠路边行驶，大雪盖路，看不到路肩，容易撞上，损坏车圈。
- 开车之前，把后视镜，挡风玻璃，侧玻璃，雨刷，车顶，车灯上的积雪。
  - 塑料头的雪铲只能用于玻璃，会损伤车漆。
  - 车漆用刷子。
  - 车顶上的雪不扫的话，车开起来一旦刹车，雪可能会滑落到前挡风玻璃，阻挡视线，看不到路况。
  - 雨刷要确保打扫干净，且没有被冻住。否则一旦下雪，需要雨刷扫雪，但是雨刷被冻住不能动，会危险。



发生侧滑怎么办

1. The general rule is to do as little as possible and allow the car to pass over the ice.

2. 移开油门，不要踩刹车。踩刹车会让情况更严重。




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Maintenance

小的 Service 4000 大的 8000 是比较合理的价格  
1万以上算是超大的了 会给你检查零件，看有没有什么该修的，当下就交钱修或者换就好了。不然下次预约又要交费。

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1e3Uo4GEF9RcELa2Dsas0WV1LN2yITX7H&sz=w1000" alt="Toyota Car Service" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

Q: Which service should I choose? Do I have to choose 6 years or 90k km?   
A: My service is done every May annually. <u>Big and small services rotates</u>. 2025 May I get small service, costs about 3.6k.  Toyota requires service either every year or every 15k km, whichever satisfied first. I will receive a SMS message about the appointment.

___

Q: How long does the service take? I need to leave my car at the store for how long time?  
A: Small service take about 1 hour. I need to drive my car to the factory 15 mins before my appointment. 

___

Q: What does the maintenance include?  
A: When the Service is completed, you will receive a year of free roadside assistance, car software updates, Hybrid health check and Toyota Relax.

___

Q: What is Toyota Relax?  
A: Toyota Relax goes significantly beyond the well-established concept of a new or used vehicle warranty to give cover that can extend for up to 10 years or 100,000 miles of driving.  The Relax warranty is automatically activated on the completion of a scheduled full or interim vehicle service at an official Toyota centre. By keeping to their vehicle’s service schedule, customers can extend their Relax warranty by an extra 12 months/10,000 miles, year after year, until the 10-year/100,000-mile limit is reached.

____

Q: What does Toyota Relax cover?  
A: The Relax warranty covers the same parts and labour as the three-year manufacturer’s warranty provided on new Toyota vehicles and the one-year manufacturer warranty that’s standard with approved used vehicles. It does NOT include wear and tear items, bodywork, paint, interior trims and maintenance parts. A vehicle health check is part of the service package, which includes all mechanical and electronic parts, which helps potential problems to be detected at an early stage. Any existing defects present at the time of service are excluded from the warranty.

## EU-kontroll

Mandatory roadworthiness test (“EU test”)

车检可以提早4个月，最好安排在保养之后。这样中间过的时间短，出问题的几率要低。

车检的时候，车要有什么问题不过关，就会限制一定期限修好，然后再车检。

**Price:** <span class="env-green">1550 kr</span> (As of 2025).

<a id="EU-kontroll-paper-receipt"></a>

        data="/Econ-Study/images/EU-Kontroll.pdf"
        width="800"
        height="500">
</object>

注意: 车送厂车检或者保养都有手续费，如果有什么事情在同期，尽量安排在一起。

> As long as your vehicle passes the test and is approved before the deadline, it is up to you how early you wish to have your vehicle tested. The deadline is final, so you should makes sure you have enough time to take the main test, to fix any defects the test may reveal, and to have the vehicle reinspected and approved.

[Check my DDL](https://www.vegvesen.no/en/vehicles/own-and-maintain/eu-mandatory-roadworthiness-test-eu-test/deadline-roadworthiness-test/?registreringsnummer=YF16565)

> - Latest approved mandatory roadworthiness test
>
>   13.01.2026
>
> - Deadline for approved mandatory roadworthiness test
>
>   <span class="env-green">**03.02.2028**</span>

Nordvik will send a reminder of the test by mails *two months* before the deadline expires.

**Timeline for EU-kontroll:**

- Book an appointment, ideally 3 months before the deadline, just in case there are issues to fix.
  
  Booked time on 2025-12-01. EU-kontroll expires on 2026-02-03.

  This time I booked the EU-kontroll 2 months before the deadline. Got an appointment one month after. It was enough time before the deadline. That's when the car is at a good condition of course.

- Take the car to the garage for the test.
  
  2026-01-14
  
  If the car passes the test, you will receive a certificate of approval.

  The EU-kontroll is rather quick, taking about 1 hour then you can collect your car.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How often is the EU-kontroll?  
A: Every 2 years.

Q: Where can I book the EU-kontroll?  
A: The Norwegian Public Roads Administration (Statens vegvesen) does not carry out roadworthiness tests, but we approve and inspect the garages / testing centre that are authorized to carry out such tests. Find a garage/testing centre near you, where you can book a session for the mandatory roadworthiness test (“EU test”).

The price of a mandatory roadworthiness test is determined by the individual garage.

**Tips:**

Might as well do the EU-kontroll at Toyota Nordvik AS Bodø where I do the maintenance. If possible, arrange the EU-kontroll right after the maintenance.

Nordvik Bodø: Bestill EU-kontroll via [link](https://www.nordvik.no/verksted). Use Chrome browser to open the link. Safari won't allow the pop-up window. [This works. Takes about one day to get the appointment confirmation by email.]

✅ Call [+ 47 7552 9100](tel:+4775529100) to book the EU-kontroll with Nordvik. Accept an appointment whatsoever. You can then call after, to check if there is any slot available earlier.

- Better to arrange the EU-kontroll <span style="color: #00CC66;">three months</span> before the deadline, so you have sufficient time to fix any issues if anything happens. Or sometimes the workshop has a long queue and not easy to book a slot.
