### Add Page Number

Add page number when you are finished if you need to insert total number of pages.

1. Format your page number in Slide Master.

   Add total number of pages: `page â€¹#â€º of 20`. Yes, you need to add the total number manually every time you add or remove one page. It's so stupid! MS hates humanity and Mac. 

2. Go back to Normal View and Insert page number.

Note that if you make changes to footers or slide numbers in the Slide Master, the changes will <span style='color:#FF9900'>NOT</span> be applied automatically. You need to re-insert to apply the changes. It is a two-step process.

MS is just anti-human. Every time I use MS software, I feel my patience is tested and challenged greatly. About to lash out! How can MS be so stupid at this AI taking over age? ðŸ¤¯ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥



**Don't show on title slide**

It means don't show the page number but still it counts as a page...

If you meant don't count the title as one page, you can set the page number to `Starts at: 0`.



Q: How does ppt determine title page?  
A:  PowerPoint always treats the first layout listed under a master slide as a title slide.

### Change Font Size of Notes in Normal view

Q: The font size of notes in Normal view is too small to read. How to change it?

A: To change the Notes text size: go to View > Notes Master and change the font size there. I set the font size to 20pt (defaults to 12pt). When you close the Notes Master view, the notes text size in Normal view will be updated.

Note that 12pt is optimal for printing, but too small for reading on screen. 20pt is good for reading on screen, but too large for printing.

If it does not work, try the following steps:

1. Choose View > Outline View.
2. Right-click in the left-hand outline pane and choose Show Formatting.
3. Select the notes, right-click on the selection and set the point size.
