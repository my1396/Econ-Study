Things to improve on: hesitation, anticipation, judgement call.

-   change gears: pulling out to the right; traffic light, joining dual carriageways;
-   speed limit
-   observations when do maneuvers



### Lesson 1  – June 7, 2023

Driving evaluation. From Uni, went to Driving test center, then to Cowley RA, to Blackbird Leys, A4142, to A40W, back to Uni.

Need to work on looking further ahead, anticipation.

-   Quarry Hollow. Need to look forther ahead for oncoming cars. Road is narrow, if going ahead without looking for a clear way, will risk stuck in the middle.
-   Narrow roads 
    -   parked cars. If need to go around, need to make sure there is no oncoming vehicles.
    -   bus stopping for pessenger. If there is an oncoming vehicle, then it's better to hold back. You might not have enough time to overtake before the oncoming car arrives.
-   Look ahead for amber lights and stop.
    -   Headington RA from A4142 to A40W.
-   Following signs from roadworkers.
    -   "Go" or "Stop" sign.
    -   Hand gesture.
-   Pedestrians
    -   if there is an island in the middle, cars have priority if pedestrians haven't started walking.
    -   if there is no island, only Zebra crossing or colored roads, have to give way to pedestrians.



### Lesson 2 – June 14, 2023

Practiced busy road situation. On RAs, lane discipline is more important than indication. 抓大放小，没有必要追求完美。

-   车速降下来之后要换挡。



### Lesson 3 – June 21, 2023

DTC mini-RA

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/image-20230119070643057.png" alt="image-20230119070643057" style="zoom:50%;" />

-   B $\rightarrow$ A, 开太快，没看到从C2来的车。C2会被C1挡住，所以要开慢。
-   A $\rightarrow$ B, C2有一个公交车过来，形成一个shield，此时可以走。
-   C2 $\rightarrow$ A, half on half off, and do not swerve to left, keep the wheel right. 

General driving

-   换挡要快。否则车速会降下来。
-   Kassam Stadium RAs, speed up when you exit, build up speed fast. 



### Lesson 4 – June 26, 2023

Lesson with Amar

Went to Barton; need to practice Headinton RA from Oxford to Barton (3rd exit); 

-   major faults today
    -   crossroads at Barton, closed crossroads, need to crawl out, make sure it's safe to drive on;
    -   turing left to DTC: be mindful of pedestrians, if there is someone waiting, just pause with car straight, and smile to gesture them go; do not hand wave; I was pausing with car head blocking the cycle lane;
    -   mini-RA at DTC, if you have already committed passing, even if there is a car coming from your right indicating right, you must carry on. Braking and stopping is the worst reaction. 
    -   If there is a bus or truck on your right lane turning right, you must hold back, because their tail will swing out. 
-   If starting off at a position too close to the front car, just reverse back a bit, then go forward again.
-   When approaching traffic lights at RAs on dual carriageways, go 3rd gear first then 2nd gear, even if you are going to stop. Otherwise speed is too fast for the gear, will cause bumps and engine struggles. 
-   Can improve on making decisions like where to pause when giving way to oncoming vehicles.
-   Headington RA Barton Exit
    -   From Headington, use the left lane, must turn left b/c you will exit onto the turning left lane;

-   Practice Risinghurst, Quary, Barton; Mini-RA at DTC twice at every lesson;



### Lesson 5 – June 29, 2023

-   two major faults
    -   didn't give way to cars on the right on mini-RA at Barton
    -   start off at 2nd gear at the mini-RA at DTC
-   if car struggles when chaning gear from 4th to 3rd, lift clutch slowly.
-   From A4142 to Barton, 3rd exit, need to get to the right lane before the traffic light, then use the middle lane to go to Barton.
    -   traffic can get busy, then you have difficulty move to the right lane.
-   Pulling out from a side road, if one car is pulling in, it gives you a shield to pull out. Could go at that moment.
-   At 4-way mini-RAs, if cars at the opposite exit indicating right, 
    -   if I am turning left $\rightarrow$ they have priority.
    -   if I am turning right too $\rightarrow$ no on has priority. The car who arrived first has priority. If arriving at the same time, use eye contact and gestures to communicate with the driver.



### Lesson 6 – July 6, 2023

Practice with Amar Littlemore area, give way signs.

-   30 speed limit emerging from Sandhill.
    -   The sign is before the Risinghurst emerging point. There is giving way line, so cars on the dual carriageway have priority.

-   Littlemore RA from Iffley road, 2nd exit (to Littlemore area) and 3rd exit (Ring Road to Swindon).
    -   when to pull away. If you see a car on the right, must pause even if you are already beyond the waiting line. If there is red light and a queue, you couldn't pull out either, otherwise, you will block the exit.
    -   2nd exit to Littlemore area, using middle lane, move to the left lane after the 1st exit if it is safe to do so;
    -   3nd exit to Ring Rd Swindon, using middle or right lane. If using right lane, move to the middle lane after the 1st exit if it is safe to do so.
-   Hill start
    -   handbrake completely down, completely off the brake, then hold clutch ang give gas to go; 
    -   don't roll back, handbrake very high.
-   Duel carriageway, must have a safe gap before you move back to the left lane.
    -   there was a lorry and I overtook it, I attempted to move back without a safe gap.
-   Meet oncoming vehicles
    -   look way ahead
-   Mini-RA at DTC
    -   when cars on the left are on the RA, I can go.
-   Pulling over need to go slow and turn left hard, then turn right
    -   I had a very wide gap;
-   How to tell if I stalled or not: look the the rev meter. If it is above zero, then I am not stalling.
-   Next time: pratice Sandhill, Risinghurst; Littlemore; hill start; Sat-Nav TomTom;





### Lesson 7 – July 12, 2023

Two major faults

-   [gears] Joining dual carriageway before Littlemore RA, forgot to change to 1st gear. Could stall and block the duel carriageway.

    -   beware of the double dashed line with white triangle, must stop to give way. It overrides any other priorities.
    -   if I am driving on the dual carriageway, I need to help cars join by slowing down or moving to the right lane. 
        -   If you are taking the 2nd exit (use the left lane), don't move to the right lane, just slow down to help others join. You can use the middle lane, but it is more difficult.
        -   If you are taking the 3rd exit (use the right lane), you can move to the right lane to help others join the dual carriageway.

-   [joining RAs] Kassam Stadium RAs, the last RA, one car indicating right, I didn't slow down enough, had to brake abruptly. Never let the guard down because all previous RAs are empty and easy.

-   Littlemore RA from Iffley, do not block the exit.



### Lesson 8 – July 21, 2023

Route for next lesson: 

A4142 5th exit onto A40E/Wheatley 

Then exit into Wheatley and go to Wheatley ASDA 

Then back into Risinghurst from dual carriageway left turn 

Then back to the driving test centre.

Other things to practice: Hill start, maneuvers.



Major faults today

-   Mini-RA at DTC
    -   one blocker almost finishing, and I was hesitant so that I missed the joining window, but I joined anyway, the car on the right moved too, making me stop beyond the waiting line. Have to wait for two blockers in the case that the 1st blocker planning to join or already on the RA.
    -   Have to give more gas when starting off.
    -   Going to the DTC, 2nd exit, must go half-on, half-off, otherwise blocking the way of the left lane.
-   Approaching traffic light at ~40m/h, if you are more than 40 and the light is turning amber, you drive on, do not stop abruptly.

Other things

-   Quarry use 1st geat. If going up, give way to cars coming down. Do not go on the pavement.
-   Closed junctions. Especially at residential areas, must stop to observe. Not emerging first then observe. Can't have the head sticking out.
-   In 30m/h areas, do mirrors and signals early, 8-10 car lengths, so that people know your intention and take actions early.
-   Going back to Marston, Cherwell Drive, it's narrow but ok for two small cars. When you meet a bus and truck, must stop to give way. Let the bus or truck pass, then you drive on.
-   Cowley RA
    -   A4142, 4th exit to Ring Rd Swindon, do not exit to the slip road too early, wait for the arrow.
    -   Right lane then middle lane. Lane discipline, do not ride two lanes.
    -   If there is pedestrian crossing, must wait until they finish then start off.
    -   When you do not have a clear exit, <span style='color:red'>do not join the RA and block the exit</span> for other cars on the RA.
        -   This applies to Littlemore joining from Iffley. Do not be the 3rd car. Should be only 2 cars waiting for the traffic light.



### Lesson 9 – July 25, 2023

Wheatley

-   Giving way lines at Wheatley; follow signs for direction.
-   Bays at the car park are slanted. Need to adjust for the angle.

Other things

-   forget to change gears.
-   observations when do maneuvers.
-   joining duel carriageways.
-   mini-RA at DTC.



### Lesson 10 – Aug 02, 2023

-   Don't forget to change gears!
-   Don't go above speed limits especially in quiet neighborhoods!
-   Don't go around cars who is doing paralle parking. Must pause and make sure the car stopped for you. 
-   Headington RA Barton exit, don't be over hesitant to pull out. 
    -   <span style='color:chartreuse'>uncontrolled joining RA</span> (the traffic light is not for me) !
    -   make sure it's clear on your right. Cars will come from both A40W Northway and Headington direction. 
    -   do not join the roundabout and block the exit! Keep the exit clear.
    -   Barton entrance is very similar to Littlemore RA Iffley entrance. Same principle applies.
-   Pulling out from Quarry to A4142, was too hesitant.
    -   because there is traffic light, cars are going slower than usual dual carriageways.
-   1st exit on St Clement's RA, still need to give way to cars on the RA! 
    -   b/c it feels like you didn't join the RA, sometimes just want to go without careful observation.



### Lesson 11 – Aug 04, 2023

Practice Barton exit, Sat-Nav, pull out to the right.

[Merlin Route](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBsfYjQKDd4)

From the DTC, turn left to Holloway, turn left to Garsington Rd, through Business Park RA, at Cowley RA, taking 4th exit to Swindon; 

-   Need to make the connection Swindon $\Leftrightarrow$ Ring Rd South.

    -   4th exit to Swindon, exit onto the right lane; need to move back to the left lane; need to make sure it's safe before you move.

-   A4142 Exit to Sandy Lane West

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/exit to sandy lane.png" alt="exit to sandy lane" style="zoom:50%;" />

    After exit, it's a very sharpe bend and there is a 20 speed limit sign and give way line!

    At the give way line, don't need to stop as long as you have a clear way.

-   Then you go to Blackbird Leys area. Be aware of the mini-RA. Turn right at the 3rd min-RA.

    -   give way to the right-hand side.

**Headington RA — Barton Exit** 

They only go from London road second exit into Barton for now (the exit is before 12 o clock so stick to the left lane really and then turn left when in Barton)

-   You can use left or middle lane, either is ok.

From Barton 

-   Lane choice: 
    -   left lane: A40E and A4142
    -   middle lane: A4142 and city center OXF
    -   right lane: A40W Northway
-   City centre exit: take the middle lane  
    A4142: take the left lane
