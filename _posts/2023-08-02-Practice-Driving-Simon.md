Things to improve on: hesitation, anticipation, judgement call.

-   change gears: pulling out to the right; traffic light, joining dual carriageways;
-   watch out for speed limit!
-   observations when do maneuvers
-   joining dual carriageways, <span style='color:red'>don't undercut. [✘] </span>



### **Show me** 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/show me Q.png" alt="show me Q" style="zoom:70%;" />

Wash windscreen

-   use right lever. Pull to the front is front window. Pull the back is back window.



Dimmed lights

-   Default is D autolamp (Autolamps turn the headlamps on in low light situations or when the windshield wipers operate).
-   To turn on dipped headlights, rotate one to the left to choose C.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/ext light.png" alt="ext light" style="zoom:50%;" />



Switch from dipped to main/high beam:

1.  Switch on the headlights

2.  Push the left lever away from you to activate main beam and pull the left lever back towards you to deactivate main beam.

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/high beam.png" alt="high beam" style="zoom:50%;" />

Fog light

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/demister back.png" alt="demister back" style="zoom:50%;" />



### **Tell me**

1.   brakes

     >   Not spongy or slack. Tested when start off, should not pull to one side.

2.   tyre pressure

     >   manufacture's guide. 
     >
     >   use a gauge. check when the tyres are cold, remember spare tyre and valve cap.

3.   head restraint position

     >   the rigid part should be at least as high as your eyes or top of your ears.
     >
     >   as close to your head as is comfortable.

4.   tyre tread depth and general condition

     >   No bulges or cuts. 
     >
     >   1.6mm for the central 3/4 of the tyre and the whole outer circumference.

5.   headlights and tail lights

     >   operate switch, and step outside and check.

6.   direction indicators

     >   operate switch, and step outside and check.

7.   brake lights

     >   apply on the brake pedal, use reflection in the window or doors, or ask someone to help.

8.   fog lights

     >   turn on dipped headlights and operate switch. The warning light should be on.
     >
     >   Used in the fog or visibility reduces to below 100 m.

9.   anti-lock braking system

     >   if there is problem, the warning light should be on.

10.   power assistant steering system

      >   if the steering becomes heavy, then the system fails.
      >
      >   Two ways to check:
      >
      >   1)   apply pressure on the steering, when you start off, you should notice a slight movement as the system starts to work.
      >   2)   turn the wheel right after you move off, it should give you an immediate indication whether the system is working.

11.   open bonnet and tell me ...

      1.   engine oil
      2.   engine coolant
      3.   brake fluid

### Lesson 1  – June 7, 2023

Driving evaluation. From Uni, went to Driving test center, then to Cowley RA, to Blackbird Leys, A4142, to A40W, back to Uni.

Need to work on looking further ahead, anticipation.

-   Quarry Hollow. Need to look forther ahead for oncoming cars. Road is narrow, if going ahead without looking for a clear way, will risk stuck in the middle.
-   Narrow roads 
    -   parked cars. If need to go around, need to make sure there is no oncoming vehicles.
    -   bus stopping for pessenger. If there is an oncoming vehicle, then it's better to hold back. You might not have enough time to overtake before the oncoming car arrives.
-   Look ahead for amber lights and stop.
    -   Headington RA from A4142 to A40W.
-   Following signs from roadworkers.
    -   "Go" or "Stop" sign.
    -   Hand gesture.
-   Pedestrians
    -   if there is an island in the middle, cars have priority if pedestrians haven't started walking.
    -   if there is no island, only Zebra crossing or colored roads, have to give way to pedestrians.



### Lesson 2 – June 14, 2023

Practiced busy road situation. On RAs, lane discipline is more important than indication. 抓大放小，没有必要追求完美。

-   车速降下来之后要换挡。
-   车速提高以后再升档。车速在前，换挡在后。



### Lesson 3 – June 21, 2023

DTC mini-RA

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/image-20230119070643057.png" alt="image-20230119070643057" style="zoom:50%;" />

-   B $\rightarrow$ A, 开太快，没看到从C2来的车。C2会被C1挡住，所以要开慢。
-   A $\rightarrow$ B, C2有一个公交车过来，形成一个shield，此时可以走。
-   C2 $\rightarrow$ A, half on half off, and do not swerve to left, keep the wheel right. 

General driving

-   换挡要快。否则车速会降下来。
-   Kassam Stadium RAs, speed up when you exit, build up speed fast. 



### Lesson 4 – June 26, 2023

Lesson with Amar

Went to Barton; need to practice Headinton RA from Oxford to Barton (3rd exit); 

-   major faults today
    -   crossroads at Barton, closed crossroads, need to crawl out, make sure it's safe to drive on;
    -   turing left to DTC: be mindful of pedestrians, if there is someone waiting, just pause with car straight, and smile to gesture them go; do not hand wave; I was pausing with car head blocking the cycle lane;
    -   mini-RA at DTC, if you have already committed passing, even if there is a car coming from your right indicating right, you must carry on. Braking and stopping is the worst reaction. 
    -   If there is a bus or truck on your right lane turning right, you must hold back, because their tail will swing out. 
-   If starting off at a position too close to the front car, just reverse back a bit, then go forward again.
-   When approaching traffic lights at RAs on dual carriageways, go 3rd gear first then 2nd gear, even if you are going to stop. Otherwise speed is too fast for the gear, will cause bumps and engine struggles. 
-   Can improve on making decisions like where to pause when giving way to oncoming vehicles.
-   Headington RA Barton Exit
    -   From Headington, use the left lane, must turn left b/c you will exit onto the turning left lane;

-   Practice Risinghurst, Quary, Barton; Mini-RA at DTC twice at every lesson;



### Lesson 5 – June 29, 2023

-   two major faults
    -   didn't give way to cars on the right on mini-RA at Barton
    -   start off at 2nd gear at the mini-RA at DTC
-   if car struggles when chaning gear from 4th to 3rd, lift clutch slowly.
-   From A4142 to Barton, 3rd exit, need to get to the right lane before the traffic light, then use the middle lane to go to Barton.
    -   traffic can get busy, then you have difficulty move to the right lane.
-   Pulling out from a side road, if one car is pulling in, it gives you a shield to pull out. Could go at that moment.
-   At 4-way mini-RAs, if cars at the opposite exit indicating right, 
    -   if I am turning left $\rightarrow$ they have priority.
    -   if I am turning right too $\rightarrow$ no one has priority. The car who arrived first has priority. If arriving at the same time, use eye contact and gestures to communicate with the driver.



### Lesson 6 – July 6, 2023

Practice with Amar Littlemore area, give way signs.

-   be aware of the 30 speed limit after emerging from Sandhill.
    -   The sign is before the Risinghurst emerging point. There is giving way line, so cars on the dual carriageway have priority.
    -   The 30 speed limit is for cars on the dual carriageway to slow down to help cars emerging and joining the dual carriageway.
    
-   Littlemore RA from Iffley road, 2nd exit (to Littlemore area) and 3rd exit (Ring Road to Swindon).
    -   when to pull away. If you see a car on the right, must pause even if you are already beyond the waiting line. If there is red light and a queue, you couldn't pull out either, otherwise, you will block the exit.
    -   2nd exit to Littlemore area, using middle lane, move to the left lane after the 1st exit if it is safe to do so;
    -   3nd exit to Ring Rd Swindon, using middle or right lane. If using right lane, move to the middle lane after the 1st exit if it is safe to do so.
-   Hill start
    -   handbrake completely down, completely off the brake, then hold clutch ang give gas to go; 
    -   don't roll back, handbrake very high.
-   Duel carriageway, must have a safe gap before you move back to the left lane.
    -   there was a lorry and I overtook it, I attempted to move back without a safe gap.
-   Meet oncoming vehicles
    -   look way ahead
-   Mini-RA at DTC
    -   when cars on the left are on the RA, I can go.
-   Pulling over need to go slow and turn left hard, then turn right
    -   I had a very wide gap;
-   How to tell if I stalled or not: look the the rev meter. If it is above zero, then I am not stalling.
-   Next time: pratice Sandhill, Risinghurst; Littlemore; hill start; Sat-Nav TomTom;





### Lesson 7 – July 12, 2023

Two major faults

-   [gears] Joining dual carriageway before Littlemore RA, forgot to change to 1st gear. Could stall and block the duel carriageway.

    -   beware of the double dashed line with white triangle, must stop to give way. It overrides any other priorities.
    -   if I am driving on the dual carriageway, I need to help cars join by slowing down or moving to the right lane. 
        -   If you are taking the 2nd exit (use the left lane), don't move to the right lane, just slow down to help others join. You can use the middle lane, but it is more difficult.
        -   If you are taking the 3rd exit (use the right lane), you can move to the right lane to help others join the dual carriageway. 

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/image-20230712125559981.png" alt="image-20230712125559981" style="zoom:50%;" />

-   [joining RAs] Kassam Stadium RAs, the last RA, one car indicating right, I didn't slow down enough, had to brake abruptly. Never let the guard down even if all previous RAs are empty and easy to pass. Could fail at the very last minute.

-   Littlemore RA from Iffley, do not block the exit.



### Lesson 8 – July 21, 2023

Route for next lesson: 

A4142 5th exit onto A40E/Wheatley 

Then exit into Wheatley and go to Wheatley ASDA 

Then back into Risinghurst from dual carriageway left turn 

Then back to the driving test centre.

Other things to practice: Hill start, maneuvers.



Major faults today

-   Mini-RA at DTC
    -   one blocker almost finishing, and I was hesitant so that I missed the joining window, but I joined anyway, the car on the right moved too, making me stop beyond the waiting line. Have to wait for two blockers in the case that the 1st blocker planning to join or already on the RA.
    -   better to be hesitant than rushing. Hesitant is minor, rushing can be dangerous and lead to fail.
    -   Have to give more gas when starting off.
    -   Going to the DTC, 2nd exit, must go half-on, half-off, otherwise blocking the way of the left lane.
-   Approaching traffic light at ~40m/h, if you are more than 40 and the light is turning amber, you drive on, do not stop abruptly.

Other things

-   Quarry: use 1st gear. If going up, give way to cars coming down. Do not go on the pavement.
-   Closed junctions. Especially at residential areas, must stop to observe. Not emerging first then observe. Can't have the head sticking out.
-   In 30m/h areas, do mirrors and signals early, 8-10 car lengths, so that people know your intention and take actions early.
-   Going back to Marston, Cherwell Drive, it's narrow but ok for two small cars. When you meet a bus and truck, must stop to give way. Let the bus or truck pass, then you drive on.
-   Cowley RA
    -   A4142, 4th exit to Ring Rd Swindon, do not exit to the slip road too early, wait for the arrow.
    -   Right lane then middle lane. Lane discipline, do not ride two lanes.
    -   If there is pedestrian crossing, must wait until they finish then start off.
    -   When you do not have a clear exit, <span style='color:red'>do not join the RA and block the exit</span> for other cars on the RA.
        -   This applies to Littlemore joining from Iffley. Do not be the 3rd car. Should be only 2 cars waiting for the traffic light.



### Lesson 9 – July 25, 2023

Wheatley

-   Giving way lines at Wheatley; follow signs for direction.
-   Bays at the car park are slanted. Need to adjust for the angle.

Other things

-   forget to change gears.
-   observations when do maneuvers.
-   joining duel carriageways.
-   mini-RA at DTC.



### Lesson 10 – Aug 02, 2023

-   Don't forget to change gears!
-   Don't go above speed limits especially in quiet neighborhoods!
-   Don't go around cars who is doing paralle parking. Must pause and make sure the car stopped for you. 
-   Headington RA Barton exit, don't be over hesitant to pull out. 
    -   <span style='color:chartreuse'>uncontrolled joining RA</span> (the traffic light is not for me) !
    -   make sure it's clear on your right. Cars will come from both A40W Northway and Headington direction. 
    -   do not join the roundabout and block the exit! Keep the exit clear.
    -   Barton entrance is very similar to Littlemore RA Iffley entrance. Same principle applies.
-   Pulling out from Quarry to A4142, was too hesitant.
    -   because there is traffic light, cars are going slower than usual dual carriageways.
-   1st exit on St Clement's RA, still need to give way to cars on the RA! 
    -   b/c it feels like you didn't join the RA, sometimes just want to go without careful observation.

### Lesson 11 – Aug 04, 2023

Practiced with Amar today.

[Merlin Route](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBsfYjQKDd4)

From the DTC, turn left to Holloway, turn left to Garsington Rd, through Business Park RA, at Cowley RA, taking 4th exit to Swindon; 

-   Need to make the connection Swindon $\Leftrightarrow$ Ring Rd South.

    -   4th exit to Swindon, exit onto the right lane; need to move back to the left lane; need to make sure it's safe before you move.

-   A4142 Exit to Sandy Lane West

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/exit to sandy lane.png" alt="exit to sandy lane" style="zoom:50%;" />

    After exit, it's a very sharpe bend and there is a 20 speed limit sign and give way line!

    At the give way line, don't need to stop as long as you have a clear way.

-   Then you go to Blackbird Leys area. Be aware of the mini-RA. Turn right at the 3rd min-RA.

    -   give way to the right-hand side.

**Headington RA — Barton Exit** 

They only go from London road second exit into Barton for now (the exit is before 12 o clock so stick to the left lane really and then turn left when in Barton)

-   You can use left or middle lane, either is ok.

From Barton 

-   Lane choice: 
    -   left lane: A40E and A4142
    -   middle lane: A4142 and city center OXF
    -   right lane: A40W Northway
-   City centre exit: take the middle lane  
    A4142: take the left lane

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/image-20230802220639843.png" alt="image-20230802220639843" style="zoom:50%;" />



**Two major faults**:

-   Joining A4142 from Garsinton Rd, undercut cars on the right.
    -   Take time to build up speed. Don't rush it.
-   Littlemore 3rd exit to Iffley, indicate too early at the 1st exit.
    -   indicate at about the 2nd exit. Do thorough observations when moving to the left. Cars could take the wrong lane and do not leave the RA when they should have, leaving me in a jar, couldn't move to the left lane. 
    -   just do observations, let cars on your left go and move to the left lane gradually. If they slow and and give way to you, then you move to the left lane.
    -   It is ok if you haven't moved to the left lane before the traffic light. You could even do it after the traffic light. 
    -   BRM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6MFSU-rGRg&t=1406s 5:20
    
        <span style='color:red'>Do NOT indicate and move to the left lane too early.  [✘] </span>The video only moved to the left right before the traffic light at the 2nd exit.

**Other things**:

-   Sat-nav
    -   when they say bear left, need to change lane and be prepared to turn.
    -   look at the top of the sat-nav for the general direction where to you. So you don't get taken by surprise.
    -   listen to what the sat-nav speaks! E.g., Cowley RA from A4142, bear left and take the 1st exit. Meaning exit dual carriageway to the left lane then take the 1st exit to BBL.
    -   Joining Cowley RA from A4142, cars are packed up on the left lane, usually it's ok to move to the right if you find you are on the wrong lane, but it's difficult to move to the left if you are on the right lane.
    -   Cowley RA is busy and cars make mistakes at choosing lane, so expect cars could cut into your lane. Be aware of cars beside you. If there is a van or truck, ease up the gas, slow down, go at 13-15m/h. 
-   BBL
    -   build-up areas, still need to build up speed around 20. Don't go below the speed.
    -   Entering the car park at 1st gear, go to the middle row.
-   Went to Barton car park too. Treat the same as the BBL car park, 1st gear.
-   Wheatley car park, go to the cyclist parking area. Usually quieter there. Entrance area could get really busy.
-   Join dual carriageway A4142 from Sandy Lane West. Look for a safe gap, then pull away. Don't forget gears. Move to the right lane if going to Iffley.
-   At the DTC mini-RA, also being a bit too hesitant. If the gap on your right is big enough, should just go.
-   Calm down when starting off. I tend to make major mistakes when I start driving.



___

### Lesson 12 – Aug 07, 2023

-   Maneuvers
    -   must pause when you see other cars pulling out. Due observations! 
    -   starting off, must do observations first, make sure no cars are coming from behind. Then pull out! 
    -   <span style='color:red'>Can't fail on the same error twice, can I? That would be outrageously stupid. [✘] </span>
-   Exit to Marston from A40W. 
    -   wait for the arrow. Do not exit too early. Will drive on solid line.
    -   Headington RA from London Rd to A40W, 1st exit, do not indicate left. You are on the dual carriageways already. Not a slip road. So do not indicate right.
-   Bus pulling out. Either give way or overtake. Once made the decision, must follow. Don't swerve and change your decision at last moment.
-   Don't ride on the cycle lane when road is wide (Marston Ln coming off A40W).
-   Don't forget to change to 2nd gear when doing junctions, roundabouts. Gives you more control.
-   Wing mirrors shouldn't be too low. Leave a decent triangle. Mounting the curb is a fail, while a wide gap, you can fix it.



___

### Lesson 13 – Aug 08, 2023

Test date: Barton Route, Examiner: Claire is nice.

If changed address, better to apply for "[change of address on your provisional driving licence](https://www.gov.uk/change-address-driving-licence)" before taking the test, that way, the driving license will be sent automatically to your updated address. The process will be faster.

Otherwise you need to apply by post for a new license. Need to fill out a D1 form (get D1 form post office) and send to DVLA. Also need to send along your BRP card. Meaning can't travel abroad for at least one month.

- Should arrive within 3 weeks of DVLA receiving the application.

  If your licence not arriving in this time, phone 0300 790 6801 8am-7pm Mon-Fri; or 8am-2pm Sat.

- You only need to apply for your full licence if:

  - you did not give your provisional photocard driving licence to the examiner after the test, for example because you need to use it as ID
  - you changed your name or address and it’s now different from the name or address on the provisional photocard driving licence
  - you have an old-style provisional driving licence (one issued before 1998)

  Otherwise, it’ll be sent to you automatically.

- How to apply

  https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-your-full-driving-licence

  If you’re applying for a full licence, you need to:

  - sign the declaration on your driving test pass certificate

  - fill in form D1 ‘application for a driving licence’ - you can [order DVLA forms online](https://www.gov.uk/dvlaforms) or get them at [post offices](http://www.postoffice.co.uk/branch-finder)

  - include original documents confirming your identity

  - include a passport photograph (only if you have a paper provisional licence)

  - include your provisional licence.

  Send all documents to:

  > DVLA 
  > Swansea 
  > SA99 1BN

  Their website says send to DVLA, Swansea, SA99 1BN. 

  The back of my pass certificate says send to DVLA Swansea, SA99 1BJ.

  It doesn't matter which postal code you use, it will arrive at the same building.

  <span style='color:chartreuse'>Provide a return address!</span>

  https://www.mumsnet.com/talk/am_i_being_unreasonable/3791373-to-be-a-bit-annoyed-by-dvla

- If you’re applying for a full licence by post, you must send documents to the DVLA within 2 years of passing your test or you’ll have to take it again.
