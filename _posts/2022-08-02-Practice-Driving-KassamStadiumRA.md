- Grenoble Rd 2: take the 1st exit; the first open you meet is only a farm entrance, not an exit! 

  -   Take the left lane, no signal when entering, signal left when leaving.

- The penultimate roundabout

  - 1st exit is on the left side, do need to <span style="color:#32CD32">indicate left</span> when joining b/c the 1st exit is indeed on the left, unlike other RAs whose 1st exit is on the right.

- The last exit before going back to Oxford city center, joining A4074 afterwards. 

  - Must move to the <span style='color:#32CD32'>Right lane</span>; signal right; move to the right lane with road marking "OXFORD". When you are on the right lane, just follow it through to OXF, NO need to indicate left.

  - Sometimes you are told to pull over before the roundabout. Better to go forward a bit, aiming for 1/3 of the parking distance before it ends.

  - It is a dual carriageway with central barrier. After you pull over, you need to get to the right lane if it is safe to do so.

​		After this roundabout, you go to <span style="color:#32CD32">A4074</span>; and you will reach Heyford Hill roundabout;

- **Heyford Hill roundabout**; 

  From A4074 to A4141, 2nd exit, turning right, middle lane.

___

- <span style='color:#449aff'>**From West to East**</span>, A4074 Heyford RA: <span style='color:#32CD32'>2nd exit, no indicating when joining, indicating after passing the 1st exit.</span> 1st exit usually leads to parking lots. From west to east follows the sign to Cowley. This is harder b/c the first few RAs are quite close, but the distance between RAs gets longer when you go east. 

  - Left Lane; do not indicate when joining the RA; indicate left after you have past the 1st exit.

  - If you see a car on your left, they are most likely going straight unless they are taking a U-turn or taking the 2nd exit; in either case, they'd indicate right; if you don't see a signal, assume they are going straight to your direction, which won't affect you. Meaning you carry on.

  - Grenoble RA W1

- Grenoble RA West2, 2nd exit to Cowley, turning right.

  -   left lane goes to Oxford Science Park, take the <span style='color:#32CD32'>middle lane</span>; always have a look at your right mirror for cars on your right;
  -   Use the <span style='color:#32CD32'>charcoal shading</span> to guide your position.

- Common Grenoble RAs: This is how most Kassam Stadium roundabouts look like.

  - From East to West, from Garsington—the <span style='color:#32CD32'>1st exit</span> is a bit to the right, take the <span style='color:#32CD32'>left lane</span>: do not signal when enter, signal left when leave; hug the curb;

  - From West to East, from A4074—take the <span style='color:#32CD32'>2nd exit, left lane</span>; 1st exit leads to residentail areas, business parks, parking lots;
