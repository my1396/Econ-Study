You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

**快速进入学习状态？**

1.   做一些被动接受的事情。比如听课程。主动输出，如写论文，比较困难。从轻松愉快的事情开始。听很简单，听一些相关的内容。
2.   在一个工作环境。听工作专用古典音乐，给大脑一个提示，一个氛围。
3.   坐直，眼睛向上看。

Make small changes.
