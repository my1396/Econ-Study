# Set default zoom setting

Creating an Excel addin (.xlam) with the following code:

```visual basic
Public RunWhen As Double
Private Sub Workbook_Open()
MsgBox "The Zoom will be changed to 150%."
cRunIntervalSeconds = 5 ' Update value every five seconds
cRunWhat = "ThisWorkbook.TheSub"  ' the name of the procedure to run
    RunWhen = Now + TimeSerial(0, 0, cRunIntervalSeconds)
    Application.OnTime EarliestTime:=RunWhen, Procedure:=cRunWhat, _
        Schedule:=True
End Sub
Sub TheSub()

    Dim ws As Worksheet

    For Each ws In ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets
        ws.Select
        ActiveWindow.Zoom = 150
    Next ws
    

MsgBox "Zoom has been changed."

End Sub
```

Create a blank new workbook.

1. Press Opt+F11 (or Tools > Macro > Visual Basic Editor) to activate the Visual Basic Editor.

2. In the Project Explorer pane on the left, double-click ThisWorkbook under Microsoft Excel Objects.

   Paste the code into Thisworkbook section in VBE:

   <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=197pcrzDrg8-G_sWmn-myLxP_fyPc98i4&sz=w1000" alt="VBA zoom" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

   Save the workbook as .xlam file, e.g., `SetZoom.xlam`.

3. Enable the macro setting in Excel. 

   Add this Excel addin file by: File > Add-Ins > Go... > Browse... > locate the .xlam file and then double click on it to add.

Next time after you open an existing workbook the code will run to change the Zoom value to 150%.
