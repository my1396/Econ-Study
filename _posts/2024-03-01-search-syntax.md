**Google Search**

To narrow your results in specific ways, you can use special operators in your search. Do not put spaces between the operator and your search term. A search for [`site:nytimes.com`] will work, but [`site: nytimes.com`] won't. Here are some popular operators:

**Search for an exact match:** Enter a word or phrase inside quotes. For example, [`tallest building`].

**Search for a specific site:** Enter `site:` in front of a site or domain. For example, [`site:youtube.com cat videos]`.

**Exclude words from your search:** Enter `-` in front of a word that you want to leave out. For example, [`jaguar speed -car`].
