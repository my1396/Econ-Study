### 我们内心的冲突 Karen Horney (凯伦.霍妮)

有意识地直面冲突尽管可能比较痛苦，但却是一种非常宝贵的能力。我们越能面对自己的冲突并找出解决办法，就能获得越多的内心自由感和内心力量。只有愿意承受冲突的打击，我们才最有可能成为命运之舟的主宰。<u>根植于麻木之中的虚假平静根本不值得我们羡慕。它注定会让我们更加脆弱，更加不堪一击</u>。

找出矛盾的存在并在此基础上进行决策：清楚我们的愿望是什么 (我们的感受和需要是什么) $\rightarrow$ 建立起自己的信念体系 $\rightarrow$ 与周围环境推崇的价值观产生冲突 $\rightarrow$ 直面冲突 (并找出解决办法)



### 认知觉醒 — 开启自我改变的原动力 周岭

我们看待这个世界的视角是不同的。在能主动做成一件事之前，我们眼里的世界是二维的、扁平的。然而在能主动做成一件事情之后，我们就能够从侧视的角度，看到三维的、立体的世界，注意到人与人在认识水平上的差别。

我此前一直强调“想清楚”的重要性，但当我们绞尽脑汁去想却仍然想不清楚的时候，就要依据前人的假设先行动起来，只有这样，我们才能更接近目标的本质，才能想得更清楚。

很多人总是希望先找到自己的人生目标再行动，事实上，如果不行动，我们可能永远也找不到自己的人生目标，毕竟依靠低维度的认知和经历，我们很难看清自己真正想要什么。只有先依据前人的假设走到更高的层次，人生目标才可能慢慢浮现。

大脑影响行为，行为也影响大脑。

可以把大脑推到活动范围的顶端。





需要弄清楚，让你焦虑和压力陡升的是什么。一个小工具 — 填空游戏。

> 当我 __________________ (感到焦虑的社交场合)时，我 __________________ 。

> E.g.,
>
> 当我 <u>和不止一个人闲聊时</u>，我 <u>大脑一片空白</u>。
>
> 当我 遇到一个陌生人时，我 找不到话题跟别人聊。

Get specific. What exactly is *the worst that can happen*? What particular stupid thing *do I expect I will do*? *Who*, precisely, do I expect *is going to judge me*? 

How bad is that really? How bad is a little bit of judgement?

What are the odds? How could I cope?

Use Embrace to show yourself some compassion: talk to yourself as you would to a good friend. Soothe, encourage, and support.



**Get started and your confidence will catch up.**

Strike up a conversation. Not unctuous, not fake. Start talking to them as if a relationship had already been established, as if we'd known each other for a very long time.

> Just have to do it so many times. There were no longer any unknowns ... there was nowhere for my imagination to go and create this kind of anxiety in me. I had seen it all before, I knew that I could handle it, and so I got to the point where I could just approach people very comfortably without any worry or anxiety about what their reaction would be.

If you want to be comfortable talking to strangers, the only way to do it is to approach strangers while you are uncomfortable. You have to earn the comfort through being uncomfortable many, many times.

> Fake it till you make it. When you see yourself doing it, you start to believe you can.

When we don't feel like getting on the yoga mat, lacing up our running shoes, sitting down to write, or getting off YouTube and focusing on work, we can use a little magic: we can put action before motivation.

> We don't have to wait until we feel like doing something before we do it. 
>
> Instead, we start doing it, and *the feeling will catch up*.

There's a myth that you have to feel confident to be ready. In truth, you gain confidence by doing things before you're ready, while you're still scared. Go through the motions and your confidence will catch up.

> Being brave isn't not being afraid. Indeed, fear is a prerequisite to bravery. True bravery is being afraid and doing it anyway.



木法沙对辛巴说过同样的话。辛巴和娜娜瘦到刀疤的蛊惑，去到鬣(liè)狗的地盘探险，不出所料的遭遇鬣狗伏击。沙祖赶去报信请救兵，木法沙即使赶到救下了辛巴和娜娜。

辛巴说：”爸爸，你好勇敢，看起来什么都不怕。“

木法沙说：“我只在必须要勇敢的时候勇敢。我刚刚就很怕，害怕失去你们。” (I thought I might lose you.)



"How to kill a mockingbird" has the similar description about bravery. 

> Courage is not a man with a gun in his hand. It's knowing you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.



The first few times will be the most difficult. Experience hasn't yet balanced out our fearful imaginings of all possible worst-case scenarios. So while you're in the tough early stages, base your achievement on what you *do* rather than how you *feel*.
