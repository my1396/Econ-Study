2. **Command line**

   Download the desired .tar.gz or (.tar.bz2) file 
   Open Terminal 
   Extract the .tar.gz or (.tar.bz2) file with the following commands 

   ```bash
   tar xvzf PACKAGENAME.tar.gz 
   tar xvjf PACKAGENAME.tar.bz2 
   ```

   Navigate to the extracted folder using cd command 

   ```bash
   cd PACKAGENAME 
   ```


     Now run the following command to install the tarball 
    
     ```bash
     ./configure 
     make 
     sudo make install
     ```


​     

`tar [options] [archive-file] [file or directory to be archived]` options:

-   `x`     extract the archive;
-   `v`     print its action on console;
-   `f`     tell `tar` which file to perform the action on;
-   `z`     compress the tar file using `gzip`
-   `j`     compress the tar file using `bzip2`



`tar xvjf PACKAGENAME.tar.gz -C / `   `-C` means changing directory.



`man tar`   to show help page for `tar`.



`echo $PATH` check `$PATH` variable. 

- stored in `~/.bash_profile`.

- in R

  ```R
  Sys.getenv("PATH")
  ```

  



`touch ~/.R/Makevars` 	create a file `~/.R/Makevars`

`source $SHELL` 	restart your session to enable new settings.



### File Management

`cp [option] <source> <destination>` 	copy the `<source>` file to the `<destination>` file or directory. If multiple `<source>` is provided, then copy all files to the  `<destination>` directory. Options:

-  `-i` 	interactive copying. Warn the user before overwriting the desitnation file.
-  `-r` or `-R`  recursive copying the entire directory structure.          



`rm DeleteMe.odt DeleteMe2.odt` 	delete multiple files.

- If there are special characters in file names, simply add quotes to file names. E.g.,

  `rm '4-way mini-roundabout.png' 'DTC.png' 'Heyford.png' 'image-20220824132439609.png' 'image-20220824133418559.png'`

- If the file doesn't exit, there will be warning message `No such file or directory`.



```bash
# delete repetitive files
post_image <- list.files("/Users/menghan/Documents/PhD Courses/Econ-Study/images")
post_image

google_drive <- list.files("/Users/menghan/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-my1396@nyu.edu/My Drive/Typora_images")
google_drive

mask <- google_drive %in% post_image
google_drive[!mask]

file_delete <- google_drive[mask]
file_delete <- as_tibble_col(file_delete, column_name = "name")
# add quotes to file names to escape special characters
file_delete <- file_delete %>% 
  mutate(new_name = paste0("'", name, "'") 
  )
file_delete
nrow(file_delete)

# cmd to delete files
paste0("rm ", paste(file_delete$new_name[1:5], collapse = " "))

length(google_drive)
length(post_image)
length(list.files("/Users/menghan/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-my1396@nyu.edu/My Drive/Typora_images"))
```



**Hardlink vs symbolic link**

- Once a hard link has been made the link is to the inode. Deleting, renaming, or moving the original file will not affect the hard link as it links to the underlying inode. Any changes to the data on the inode is reflected in all files that refer to that inode.

- Hardlinks can only refer to files within the <u>same volume</u> otherwise symbolic links will be needed. 

- <u>Symbolic links</u> point to the original file, changing the symboliclink should change the original file. 

  What will break a symbolic link is when the original file is moved to a different file or deleted.

  ```bash
  ln original_file link_file # hardlink
  ln -s original_file link_file # softlink (more felxible)
  ln –s /Users/admin/Documents /Users/admin/Desktop # create a symbolic link for my Documents folder on the Desktop
  rm /Users/admin/Desktop/Documents # remove symbolic link
  ```
