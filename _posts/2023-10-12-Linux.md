Which **shell** I am using?

Starting with macOS Catalina (10.15), Apple set the default [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) to the [Z shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) (zsh). In previous macOS versions, the default was [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)). 

- In `zsh`, the configuration file is `~/.zshrc`. 

- In `bash`, it’s `~/.bash_profile`. 

Every time you make changes with the configuration file, run the following command for the changes to take effect:

-  `source ~/.bash_profile` if you have `bash`. 

- <span style='color:#008B45'>`source ~/.zshrc`</span> if the shell is `zsh`. 





You can also type in any terminal you have opened:

```bash
$ echo $0
-zsh
```

The name of the shell will apear.

Or you could run

```bash
$ echo $SHELL
/bin/zsh
```





Relative Path

- a dot (`.`) represents the current directory
- a double dots (`..`) represents the parent directory

## Get help

`man <cmd> ` get <span style='color:#00CC66'>manual page</span> for `cmd`. E.g., `man ls` will display detailed info about the `ls` cmd, including its usage, options, and examples.

Once you’ve accessed a manual page, you can navigate through it using various commands. The common navigation keys include:

- **Spacebar:** Move forward one page.
- **Enter:** Move forward one line.
- **B:** Move backward one page.
- **Q:** Quit the manual viewer.



`whatis <cmd>`  get a short description of a command and what it does.



**Linux man pages online**: <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/index.html>

You can search cmds online using the following search box.

Error: Cannot find `man` command.

Error Message looks like: 

> This system has been minimized by removing packages and content that are not required on a system that users do not log into. 
>
> To restore this content, including manpages, you can run the 'unminimize' command. You will still need to ensure the 'man-db' package is installed.

Cause: Typically man pages for Ubuntu commands not installed on a minimal cloud server or container-based images. <u>To save hard disk space</u> and to keep container image rebuild time smaller, man pages not installed.

Fix: install man pages.

Steps:

1. Run the following commands as the root user using the `sudo` command or `su` command.

   ```bash
   sudo -i
   ## OR ##
   su -
   ```

   Now you become the root.

2. Search for Ubuntu man pages

   ```bash
   # search
   apt search manpages
   # see what the page does
   apt info man-db
   ```

3. Install man pages on server

   First update package index and then install manpages-posix package for all missing commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install man-db manpages-posix
   ```

   Now you have installed `man-db` package.

4. Install man pages for software development

   ```bash
   sudo apt install manpages-dev manpages-posix-dev
   ```

5. Then run `unminimize`. That may takes a while.

   Now you can run `man ls` to check the syntax for `ls` command.

`which [flags] [program]` locate a program file executed by the shell.

It locates the executable file associated with a given command including binaries, scripts, and aliases. This can be particularly useful when you have <u>multiple versions</u> of a program installed or when you want to verify the path of a command.

```bash
# basic syntax
# location of `vim` program
$ which vim
/usr/bin/vim
# location of the `ls` cmd
$ which ls
/bin/ls
```

Common options:

- `-a`  List all instances of executables found (instead of just the first one of each).

  If you have multiple versions of Python installed, run which to determine which version will be executed in the shell.

  ```bash
  $ which -a python
  ```

- `--version` Displays the version information of the which command.

- `--help` Provides a summary of the which command’s usage and options.



Specify flags/options for cmds: use a single dash (`-`) or a double dash (`--`). 

- `-` can be followed by any number of single-character flags.

- `--` can be followed only by a single, multi-character option.

  Using `-` is more compact, but it gets even MORE compact when you want to specify multiple flags. 

  Consider:

  ```bash
  $ ls -l --size --human-readable --group-directories-first
  $ ls -lshg
  ```

  While the two commands listed above are identical, the second one is clearly much quicker to type.
  If you use the wrong type of hyphen, for example specifying `ls -size` instead of `ls --size`, would be interpreted by the shell as equivalent to `ls -s -i -z -e`. As it happens, the `-s` options is the same as `--size`, but because there are no `z` or `e` options for the `ls` command, they are simply ignored.



` printenv` prints all <span style='color:#00CC66'>environment variables</span>.

`ps`  stands for “process status.” It displays information about a list of active processes.

If `ps` is run <u>with no argument</u>, it will print all processes which were started from the current shell. Other processes will not be shown in this case.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1ezXbldKGJqrw1kk0VOOLEECI3Mzgz55H&sz=w1000" alt="Linux ps command" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

It displays the process ID (pid=PID), the terminal associated with the process (tname=TTY), the cumulated CPU time in [DD-]hh:mm:ss format (time=TIME), and the executable name (ucmd=CMD).  Output is unsorted by default.

`ps -A` will show all processes being run on the system.



___

`echo` displays a mesage on screen.

`echo -e`  enables interpret backslash escapes

```bash
INPUT: echo "abc\n def \nghi" 
OUTPUT:abc\n def \nghi

INPUT: echo -e "abc\n def \nghi"
OUTPUT:abc
 def 
ghi
```

- `-n` 	Displays the output while omitting the newline after it.
- `-E`         The default option. Disables the interpretation of escape characters.
- `-e`         Enables the interpretation of escape characters.



___

## \$PATH Variable

**Viewing the `$PATH`**

You can check the value of the `$PATH` variable with the `echo` command"

- `echo $PATH` print `$PATH` environment variable. 

- `echo -e ${PATH//:/\\n}`  print each directory in `$PATH` on its own line.

**How the `$PATH` works**

The `$PATH` variable enables the system to locate the necessary programs without needing the full path for execution.

- When you type a command, the shell looks for executable files in the directories specified by your `PATH`. 
  - The directories are recursive, meaning if the parent folder is included, every file/folder inside is also included.
  - The order stands for precedence. 
  
- It's a list of directory paths, separated by colons (`:`). 

  For example, a default `$PATH` looks like `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`. 

  If you have installed Homebrew,  the `$PATH` should contain `/opt/homebrew/bin` (for Apple Silicon, such as M1, M2, or M3 CPUs) or `/usr/local/bin` (for macOS Intel). It should be among the <span style='color:#00CC66'>highest priority</span> directories, in a <span style='color:#00CC66'>left-most</span> position.

- If you try to run an executable file or command that isn't in one of the directories in your path, you'll receive an error that says the "Command not found".

  This often happens for programs you have installed that are not basic shell commands.

  If you don't set the Mac `$PATH`, you'll need to specify the full path to an executable every time. This can be tedious and annoying, especially for commands you use frequently.

  For example, if you install have an executable file `Kando` in the `/Applications/Kando.app/Contents/MacOS/` directory, you may add the path to the folder to `$PATH`, or else you will need to type `/Applications/Kando.app/Contents/MacOS/Kando` every time you want to run the program.

  -  Remember you may not be the only one trying to run the `Kando` program: 

    If the `cowsay`program is called by another program and the `$PATH` is not set, it won't be found and the program will fail.

- Many applications and scripts rely on the `$PATH` variable to find <span style='color:#00CC66'>necessary dependencies</span>. Without a properly set `$PATH`, these applications will fail.

  - When you install a software package, the instructions will often tell you to add a directory to the `$PATH` variable. Make sure you do NOT overlook the step to add the directory to the `$PATH` variable.




**Default Mac `$PATH`**

- Directories named `bin` are for "binaries" or executable command line programs. 

- The `sbin` directories are for system management programs. 

- The `bin` and `/usr/bin` directories are for basic command line programs provided by Apple. 

- The `/usr/local/bin` is for user-installed executables.



**Add a new directory to the `PATH`**

Add the following line to the bottom of `~/.zprofile`.

```bash
export PATH=/Users/menghan/anaconda3:$PATH
```

`~` refers to `/Users/<user-name>`; it is the home directory.

The new `$PATH` variable will be exported to the environment as a combination of the previous `$PATH` plus a new directory. 

- In the above case, the new directory comes first; it will take precedence over any directories present in the previous `$PATH`. 

  Alternatively, the new directory can be appended to the end of the `$PATH`:

  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH:/new/dir1:/dir2:/dir/path/no3"
  ```

- A `:` colon character separates the new directory path from the existing directories in the previous `$PATH`.



**Set the `$PATH` in script**

There are a number of config files containing PATH information. The following are some examples:

> **System-wide**:  
> /etc/paths
>
> **User-specific**:  
>
> 1) Bash:
>
>    ~/.bash_profile   
>    ~/.bashrc
>
> 2) Zsh
>
>    ~/.zprofile  
>    ~/.bashrc  
>    ~/.zshenv

Set the `$PATH` environment variable in the `~/.zprofile` (Zsh Shell) or `~/.bash_profile` (Bash Shell) file. 

The tilde `~/` is a Unix abbreviation for your home directory. That is, the `.zprofile` file belongs in your home directory.

Zsh recognizes four different configuration files in the user's home directory: `~/.zshenv`, `~/.zprofile`, `~/.zshrc`, and `~/.zlogin`. The article [.zshrc or .zprofile](https://mac.install.guide/terminal/zshrc-zprofile.html) explains the differences. Here is a summary:

- `~/.zshrc` (Zsh Run Control): This file is best for adjusting the appearance and behavior of the shell, such as setting command aliases and adjusting the shell prompt.

  - Loaded only for interactive shell sessions. It is loaded whenever you open a new terminal window or launch a subshell from a terminal window.

  - This is the configuration file that most developers use. 

    Use it to set <u>aliases and a custom prompt</u> for the terminal window. By convention and design, `~/.zshrc` is intended for customizing the look and feel of the interactive terminal. 

    You can also use it to set the `PATH` (which many people do) but `~/.zprofile` is preferred.

- `~/.zprofile` (Zsh Profile): This file is ideal for commands that should be executed only when the terminal window is opened, such as setting the `$PATH` environment variable.

  - Loaded for login shells (both interactive and the rare non-interactive sessions). 

  - Homebrew recommends setting the `PATH` variable here. 

    There's a reason `PATH` should be set in `~/.zprofile` and not the universal `~/.zshenv`file: the macOS runs a utility `path_helper`(from `/etc/zprofile`) that sets the `PATH` order before `~/.zprofile`is loaded.

  - MacOS uses this to set up the shell for any new terminal window. Subshells that start within the terminal window inherit settings but don't load `~/.zprofile` again.

- `~/.zshenv` This is loaded universally for all types of shell sessions (interactive or non-interactive, login or non-login). 

  - It is the only configuration file that gets loaded for non-interactive and non-login scripts <u>for automated processe</u>s like cron jobs. However, macOS overrides this for `PATH`settings for interactive shells.
  - As a beginner, you will not use this configuration file. In fact, few experienced macOS developers use it.

- `~/.zlogin` Only used for login shell configurations, loaded after `.zprofile`. This is loaded whenever you open a new terminal window.



By default, the `~/.zprofile` and `~/.zshrc` configuration files do NOT exist for a user on a new Mac. You'll need to manually create the file in your home directory to properly configure your development environment.

You can create a new file from the command line with the `touch` command:

```bash
$ touch ~/.zprofile
```

After you create the file, you can edit it.

You can use TextEdit, the default macOS graphical text editor, to edit the shell configuration files. You can open a file in TextEdit from the Mac Terminal:

```bash
$ open -e ~/.zprofile
```

You also can use the command line editors `nano` or `vim` to edit the shell configuration files. See [Shell Configuration](https://mac.install.guide/terminal/configuration.html) for more about editing shell configuration files.

For the changes in `~/.zprofile` to take effect, you have to log out and log in again. 

Alternatively, to apply the changes immediately in an existing session, you can `source`:

```bash
$ source ~/.zprofile
```

The `source` command reads and executes a shell script file, in this case resetting the shell environment with your new `$PATH` setting.

Finally, you can verify the new path settings

```bash
$ echo $PATH
```

## File Management

`touch ~/.R/Makevars` 	create a file `~/.R/Makevars`

___

`mkdir [option] <directory>` stands for "make directory." 

Create the direcotry(ies), if they do not already exist.

Common cmd flags:

- **`-p`**, `--parents` no error if existing, create parent directories as needed. Otherwise, if parent directories do not exist, will return an error.

  Ex.

  ```bash
  mkdir -p /home/demo/sub2/Test
  ```

  To create a directory called `Test` with default permissions in the `/home/demo/sub2` directory. The **`-p`** flag creates the` /home`, `/home/demo`, and `/home/demo/sub2` directories if they do not already exist.

- `-m`, `--mode`  set file mode, i.e., permissions, (as in `chmod`).

  The `mkdir` command gives `rwx` (read, write, and execute) permissions for the current user only by default.
  To add <u>all the permissions for all users</u>, specify the `-m` option with the user `777` when creating a directory.

  ```bash
  # create a directory DirM with rwx permissions
  mkdir –m777 DirM
  ```

  To create a directory called `Test` with `rwxr-xr-x` permissions in a previously created `/home/demo/sub1directory`, type the following:

  ```bash
  mkdir -m 755 /home/demo/sub1/Test
  ```

  

`cp [option] <source> <destination>` 	copy the `<source>` file to the `<destination>` file or directory. If multiple `<source>` is provided, then copy all files to the  `<destination>` directory. Options:

-  `-i` 	interactive copying. Warn the user before overwriting the desitnation file.
-  `-r` or `-R`  recursive copying the entire directory structure.          



`rm DeleteMe.odt DeleteMe2.odt` 	delete multiple files.

- If there are special characters in file names, simply add quotes to file names. E.g.,

  `rm '4-way mini-roundabout.png' 'DTC.png' 'Heyford.png' 'image-20220824132439609.png' 'image-20220824133418559.png'`

- If the file doesn't exit, there will be warning message `No such file or directory`.



___

<h3>File Permissions</h3>

**Symbolic mode**

```bash
chmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx [file_name]
```

Three permission groups: `u` for user/owner, `g` for group, `o` for others.

- **Read. (r)** The read permission allows users to view the contents of a file or list the contents of a directory.
- **Write. (w)** The write permission allows users to modify a file's contents or add, remove, or rename files within a directory.
- **Execute. (x)** The execute permission allows users to execute a file or traverse (i.e., enter) a directory. For files, execute permission is required to run the file as a [program](https://phoenixnap.com/glossary/what-is-a-program) or [script](https://phoenixnap.com/glossary/what-is-a-script). For directories, execute permission is required to access the contents of the directory.

```bash
# with symbolic mode
chmod u=rw,g=r,o=r test.txt
# with absolute mode
chmod 644 test.txt
```

Read and write for the user. Read for the members of the group. Read for other users.



**How to read linux permission**

If you type `ls -l [file_name]`, it will list the file/directory information in a long list format.

<img src="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/check-file-permissions.png" alt="File Permission" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:100%;" />

The output provides the following information:

- File permissions.
- The owner (creator) of the file.
- The group to which that owner belongs.
- The creation date.



The following example shows the permissions for a file:

```
-rw-r--r--
```

- The first character indicates the **file type** - a regular file (**`-`**), directory (**`d`**), symbolic link (**`i`**), etc.
- The next three characters represent the **user's** (owner's) permissions.
- The three characters after that are the **group's** permissions.
- The final three characters are the permissions for all **other users**.

<img src="https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/file-permission-syntax-explained.jpg" alt="File Permission" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:100%;" />



**Permission groups**

- **Owner**. The owner of a file or directory is the user who created it. By default, the owner has full control over the file or directory, including the ability to read, write, and execute it.
- **Group**. Every file and directory in Linux is associated with a specific group. Users who belong to this group have the permissions defined for the group category. Groups provide a more granular control over access to files and directories, especially in environments with multiple users.
- **All users**. The last set of symbols in the permission string represents the permissions for all other users on the system, excluding the group owner. These permissions apply to anyone who is not the owner or a member of the group associated with the file or directory.



**Absolute mode**

`chmod [number] [file_name]` change permissions of a file.

The **`[number]`** is a three-digit number in which digits represent user, group, and all users permissions, respectively. Each digit corresponds to the sum of the permissions. 

For example, `755` means read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, as well as read and execute permissions for the group and others.

The numerical values of the permission types are:

- **read** has a value of **4**.
- **write** has a value of **2**.
- **execute** has a value of **1**.
- **no permission** has a value of **0**.

Change the permissions of the `test.txt` so that only the user can read, write, and execute it:

```bash
chmod 700 test.txt
```

length(google_drive)
length(post_image)
length(list.files("~/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-my1396@nyu.edu/My Drive/Typora_images"))
```



**Hardlink vs symbolic link**

- Once a hard link has been made the link is to the inode. Deleting, renaming, or moving the original file will not affect the hard link as it links to the underlying inode. Any changes to the data on the inode is reflected in all files that refer to that inode.

- Hardlinks can only refer to files within the <u>same volume</u> otherwise symbolic links will be needed. 

- <u>Symbolic links</u> point to the original file, changing the symboliclink should change the original file. 

  What will break a symbolic link is when the original file is moved to a different file or deleted.

  ```bash
  ln original_file link_file # hardlink
  ln -s original_file link_file # softlink (more felxible)
  ln –s /Users/admin/Documents /Users/admin/Desktop # create a symbolic link for my Documents folder on the Desktop
  rm /Users/admin/Desktop/Documents # remove symbolic link
  ```



And to check the current status of the service, you'd have to use the `systemctl` command in the following manner:

```bash
systemctl status <service-name>
```

**Understanding systemctl states**:

- `active (running)`: Service is actively running in the background.
- `active (exited)`: Indicates the service was meant to be executed one time or periodically. So the service did its job and then exit upon completion.
- `active (waiting)`: It indicates the service is running but it is waiting to be triggered by some condition like a specific event.

- `inactive`: Service is not currently running.

- `enabled`: Service will be enabled at system boot time.

- `disabled`: Service is disabled and won't be started at system boot.

- `static`: It means the specific service can't be managed using systemd (or the systemctl command) and you'd need to have another init service or manage it manually.

- `masked`: This means the service is masked and can't be stated directly using the systemctl command. This can be helpful when you want to prevent accidental starting of service.

- `alias`: It indicates the service name is an alias and the service is a symlink pointing to another unit file.

- `linked`: It indicates that the service or the unit file is symbolically linked to another unit file.

## Useful Commands

`open` will open files and directories, just as if you had double-clicked the file's icon.

- `-a`  open an application.
- `-n`  Open a new instance of the application(s) even if one is already running

```bash
# open a new instance of RStudio, useful for coding in multiple sessions
open -n /Applications/RStudio.app
```

```bash
# open URL with specified browswer
open -a "Google Chrome" "https://stackoverflow.com"
```





### Donload Files

___

`wget` is a versatile tool for retrieving files from web servers and other online locations. It supports popular protocols like HTTP (web downloads), HTTPS (secure web downloads), and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for retrieving files from dedicated servers.

`wget URL` downloads the file at the specified URL.

___

[cURL](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/curl-command)

`curl` is installed by default on macOS. cURL is short for “client URL” and pronounced “curl”. 

- It is an open-source command line tool that allows you to request and transfer data over a URL using different protocols.
- By providing the URL and the options needed, you can request and download data from URLs, transfer data to URLs, and more.

`curl URL` is a simple GET request that retrieves the content of the web page and displays it in the terminal. 

`curl -o URL` `-o` means output to a file; 

To get a list of posts downloaded as a JSON file, we can use the command:

```bash
curl -o posts.json https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
```

This file will be saved in the current directory where you ran the cURL command.

To dive deeper into more complex commands, see the [cURL documentation](https://curl.se/docs/tutorial.html).

___

`clear`  clear screen; deletes all previously typed commands from the Terminal app’s view except for the name of your mac.

`source $SHELL` 	restart your session to enable new settings.

___

### Network

`ping [hostname-or-IP-address]` Test if a remote host is reachable on the network.



`curl -o [URL]/[filename]` download files.



`ssh [username]@[hostname-or-IP-address]` establish an SSH connection with a remote server.

When connecting to a remote host for the first time, you may need to generate an SSH key:

```bash
ssh-keygenCopy
```

After generating the key, copy it to the remote host:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i [path-to-PUB-key] [username]@[hostname-or-IP-address]
```



___

When copy files from Mac to your non-mac devices, such as your MP3 player, it creas a bunch of obnoxious `._` files. You can use `dot_clean` command to get rid of these ghost files.

`dot_clean -m [dir]` <span style='color:#008B45'>**Recursively**</span> remove dot-underscore files. Merges `._*` files with corresponding native files. 

Removing dot-underscore files (with `-m`) is useful when sharing files with non Mac machines.

`-m`:  Always delete dot underbar files



___

## Bash Script

A Bash script is a plain text file containing a series of commands that the Bash shell can interpret and execute sequentially. 

A Bash script starts with the Shebang line (`#!`). This line specifies the path to the interpreter that should be used to execute the script. 

For instance, we create a Bash script named `bash_script.sh` with the following two lines:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Store a number in a variable
number = 10

# Print the number
echo "The number is: $number"
```

You need to make the Bash script executable with the  `chmod` command:

```bash
$ chmod +x bash_script.sh
```

Now you can execute the script with either of the below commands:

```bash
# option 1:
$ ./bash_script.sh
# option 2:
bash bash_script.sh
```
