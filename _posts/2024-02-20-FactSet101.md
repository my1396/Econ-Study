**Main takeaway**: FactSet and SQL are tools to download data. Just download the full dataset containing what you are interested. Use other programming language to process the data. 

- It's more flexible that way. SQL is not designed to do data manipulation.
- Only do the most necessary data cleaning job in SQL. More refined data cleaning, do in R or Python.

## Reference Data

Look up FactSet ID $\rightarrow$ [**Symbology Schema**](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/symbology-api) contains mappings between FactSet Permanent Identifiers and CUSIPs,
SEDOLs, ISINs, and tickers.

- It allows users to translate from a wide variety of public universal symbols (CUSIP, SEDOL, ISIN, Bloomberg FIGI, etc.) to FactSet's native symbology.

[Dividens, Stock Splits, and Spinoffs](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/614)



### Price Adjustment Factors Used for Corporate Actions

[Online Assistant Page \#(12619)](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/12619)

**Corporate Action Events Summary**

Event Category: \
CASH_DIVS = Cash Dividends \
STOCK_DIST = Stock Distributions \
SPLITS = Splits (include forward split and reverse split) \
SPINOFFS = Spin Offs \
RIGHTS = Rights Issue



**Forward split**: an *increase* in a company‚Äôs number of shares outstanding with <u>no change in the company‚Äôs market value</u>.

E.g., Coldwater Creek (5762736) had a 3-for-2 split on 9/9/2003.

The price adjustment factor for Coldwater Creek:

2 / 3 = 0.6667 (= 3 for 2)



**Reverse split**: a *decrease* in a company‚Äôs number of shares outstanding with <u>no change in the company‚Äôs market value</u>.

E.g., Marconi Corp. (333544) had a consolidation of 5 old shares into 1 new share on 9/9/2003.

The price adjustment factor for Marconi Corp. is:

5 / 1 = 5 (= 1 for 5)



**Bonus issue**: an increase in a company‚Äôs number of shares outstanding by an allocation of additional shares at no cost to existing shareholders, causing no change to the company‚Äôs market value.

Newsphone Hellas (753862) had a 3 for 1 bonus issue on 9/2/2003.

The adjustment factor is calculated as:

1/(3+1) = 0.25 (= 4 for 1)



**Stock dividend**: represents a payment of a dividend in the form of stock rather than cash, which results in an increase in the company‚Äôs number of shares outstanding.

E.g., Test Research (6338921) had a 20% stock dividend on 9/16/2003.

The adjustment factor is calculated as:

1 / (20 / 100 + 1) = 0.83333 (= 6 for 5)



**Cash dividend**: the stock price drops by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date.

The ex-dividend date is typically the same day as the record date. If investors want to receive a stock's dividend, they have to buy shares of stock before the ex-dividend date. The **record date** is the date the company determines who are shareholders who receive dividends.

For example, suppose a stock trading for \$50 per share declares a \$0.50 dividend. On the ex-dividend date, the price adjusts to \$49.50 (\$50 minus the \$0.50 dividend) for each share as of the record date.

An announcement about cash dividends from Borregaard ASA

> # BORREGAARD ASA: SHARES TRADED EX-DIVIDEND TODAY
>
> 12/04/2024
>
> The shares in Borregaard ASA will be traded ex-dividend of NOK 3.75 per share as from today, 12 April 2024.

>
> **Contact:**
> Lotte Kvinlaug, Investor Relations Officer, +47 922 86 909
>
> This information is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5 -12 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.



**Rights issue**: represents an offering of shares to existing shareholders who hold rights that entitle them to buy newly issued shares at a discount from the current market price.



**Spinoff**

A spinoff represents a form of corporate divestiture that results in a subsidiary or division becoming an independent company. In a traditional spinoff, shares in the new entity are distributed to the parent corporation‚Äôs shareholders of record on a pro-rata basis. Spinoffs are treated as *special dividends* and FactSet calculates any special dividends that have been paid as the following:


$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Spinoff Dividend} = \text{Previous day‚Äôs closing price of the spun off company} \times \\ \text{ratio of shares being spun off of the parent company}
\end{align*}
$$


The special dividend is then used to calculate an adjustment factor:


$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Adjustment factor} = \frac{\text{Price of the Parent Security Before the Ex-date} - \text{Spinoff Dividend}}{\text{Price of the Parent Security Before the Ex-date}}
\end{align*}
$$


**Ex1**

CSR Ltd. (6238645) spun off Rinker Group Ltd. on 3/31/2003. CSR shareholders received one share of Rinker Group for each share of CSR held. CSR‚Äôs closing price on 3/28/2003 (the last trading day before the ex-date) was 6.49 AUD. The price of Rinker Group on 3/31/2003 was 4.775 AUD.

The special dividend is calculated as:


$$
4.775 \times 1 = 4.775
$$


The adjustment factor is calculated as:


$$
\frac{6.49 - 4.775}{6.49} = 0.26425
$$


The price adjustment factor for CSR is 0.26425.

**Ex2**

XTO Energy (XTO) spun off Cross Timbers Reality Trust (CRT) on 8/28/2003. Shareholders received 0.0074 shares of CRT for every one share of XTO held. The CRT price on 8/27/2003 was 22.82 USD. XTO's price on 8/27/2003 was 20.29 USD.

The special dividend is calculated as:


$$
22.82 \times 0.0074 = 0.1688868
$$


The adjustment factor is calculated as:


$$
\frac{20.29 - 0.1688868}{20.29} = 0.991677
$$


The price adjustment factor for XTO is 0.991677.

___



Closing prices must be adjusted for corporate actions (mainly <span style='color:#32CD32'>**split and dividends**</span>) to maintain comparability over time.

Calculating total return:

- Adjust for split and spin off

  See above.

- **Adjust for dividends**

  1. No adjustment. Dividends are excluded from return.
  2. Simple return. Dividends are included but not reinvested. Two options of timepoints when dividends are recorded in return:
     1. Dividends Received on exdate
     2. Dividends Received on paydate

  3. Compound return. Dividends are included and reinvested. Two options of timepoints when dividends are reinvested:
     1. Dividends reinvested on exdate.
     2. Dividends reinvested on paydate.

See [Online Assistant \#(8748)](https://my.apps.factset.com/oa/pages/20414#pretc) for detailed formulas for calculating total return.



`fp_v2.fp_basic_prices` contains daily prices (OHLC) and volume of a security. 

Note that the `fsym_id` uses a regional-level ID.

| Field Name     | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fsym_id`      | Unique FactSet-generated identifier  representing a <span style='color:#32CD32'>regional level</span> instrument |

| `currency`     | Code representing the currency in which the security or listing trades |
| `p_price`      | Closing price                                                |
| `p_price_open` | Opening price                                                |
| `p_price_high` | High price                                                   |

Q: is `p_price` the adjusted closing price?

A: No, it is raw closing price, therefore NOT of much use. You want to use the table `fp_v2.fp_total_returns_daily`, which contains total return adjusted for dividends and splits.

Return calculated based on closing price is the same as the one based on adjusted price <span style='color:#32CD32'>except for <u>when there are corporate actions</u></span>.



**Interest Expenses**

| Data Field       | Table         | Definition                                                   |

| `FF_INT_EXP_TOT` | `ff_basic_af` | Interest Expense - Total<br />Represents the total interest expense (periodic charges) and all the cost necessary to make the loan/debt available.<br />It includes: Interest expense on debt and Interest capitalized. |
| `FF_INT_INC_NET` |               | Net Interest Income.                                         |
| `FF_INT_INC`     | `ff_basic_af` | Interest income                                              |







### `fp_v2.fp_total_returns_daily` 

This table contains historical daily price returns <span style='color:#32CD32'><u>with dividends reinvested on the exdate</u></span>. That is, the return is based on the <span style='color:#32CD32'>**adjusted closing price**</span>.

Include the following 4 columns

| `one_day_pct` | Returns since the previous trade date                        |

- `currency` doesn't tell about the exchange on which the security trades as one exchange is capable of listing equitie denominated in different currencies. 
- If want to get exchange info, better to use  `fref_listing_exchange` (exchange code) or `ticker_region` (country code).



`fp_v2.fp_total_returns_cagr` contains instrument level return data covered by [FactSetGlobal Prices](https://developer.factset.com/api-catalog/factset-global-prices-api).
