Apply for Vacation

If one works 100% for a whole year, in this case, 2023, one is entitled to 25 days of paid vacation. This is calculated as approximately two days of paid vacation per month if one works 100%.

Let's say you started working 100% in June 2023; you would be entitled to approximately 13 days of paid vacation.

Workflow for Inspera Exam

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=18DOq-hvHFgs5urJJVHiNhnqXlkyuCSp_&sz=w1000" alt="Exam workflow" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:100%;" />



**Workflow**

1. Create Inspera assessment and share with the course assessor (Johanna); deadline: 2 weeks before the exam date;

2. **Examiner guidance** is to be uploaded to Inspera, this can be done after the submission deadline on the exam day. 
   - It should also be made available to students in Canvas. (cf. the examiner guidelines shall be available to students when examination results are published.)
3. Marking and grading need to be done no later than 3 weeks after the exam.



After the exame date, need to upload the solution (examiner guidance) on Inspera so that sensors get access and can start grading.



How to add examiner guidelines in Inspera:

- Open the "Grade" tab.
- Choose a topic.
- Click "Options" in the upper right corner.
- Click "Mark Scheme not found".
- Upload from computer.



Where to put grading scale criteria? For instance, A>90%, 75%<B≤90%, 55%<C≤75%, 45%<D≤55%, 35%<E≤45% and not passed is F ≤ 35%. 

After the exam, do the sensoring, do I need to export the grades from Inspera to Canvas for instance?



**Appeals**

Students can appeal up to one week after the grade has been published in Studentweb.

The external examiner is responsible for preparing the explanation of grades. Explanations are to be given in Fagersonweb.



Tips

- Create Tables in LatexiT, save to pdf then conver to png. Add table as png.

### Parking

**Bodø - Free parking spaces will be reduced from 30 April 2024**

Nord University has had a lease agreement for free parking at the Police Academy, during the construction of Noatun.
This agreement ends on 30 April, and that part of the parking area will be charged.

Other parking areas - as at the student kindergarten and Mørkvedhallen are still free parking.

This means that from 30th April there will be fewer places with free parking.

The image below shows paid parking from 30/4 (orange strip) and free parking (green fields).
