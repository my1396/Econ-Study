**How to organize a meeting**

1. Talk to people in general, spreading the words. It's like the willingness survey. See how people react and if they are willing to join.

   You will get some idea about how to organize it, when, where (physical or online).

2. Send out information: A meeting is on the way

   More information will come soon

3. Talk to more people, ask when they are available and if they can make it

4. Send out actual invitaiton

   Physical, make a room reservation

5. With digital possibility maybe.

#### Tips

- Questions types:

  - Multiple Choice [#(MC): ~40]: save time for marking, but take lots of time to create the questions

  - Open Response [#(OR): 3-4]: save time for creating questions, but more time to mark, and more room for student argument.

- Save your edits frequently, especially when you insert images or type latex formulas! 

  No auto saving in Inspera.

- Leave Section 1 empty, saving it for the Cover Page.

- It is possible to add several <span style='color:#00CC66'>multiple choices</span> in one question to create a question set with sub-questions. Click `+Insert` to add alternative sets.

  Note that for <span style='color:#00CC66'>open response</span> questions, only one response field is allowed. So one question at a time. 

  It is possible to add a "Stimulus" on the left pane, and questions inn the right pane. The stimuli provides general info applicable to all question. While students scroll through the questions in the right pane, the stimulus remains constantly visible for reference. 

  Different layouts for stimulus and questions are available in "[Section Layout](#section-layout)".

  <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1riRy6NQogp2DMgs0s-S57ELH5IQi2_5d&sz=w1000" alt="Multiple Choice" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:60%;" />

  

- Create Tables in LatexiT, copy to png, save to loacal. Add table as png pictures. 

  - You can copy and paste tables from <span style='color:#00CC66'>Microsoft Word</span> to Inspera. 
  
    This feature is convenient as it is easier to edit tables in Word or Excel.
  
  - Inspera does NOT supoort html syntax; Canvas supports html.





**Appearance Design**

- Could choose for instance, whether to show TOC, hide question titles, ...

- Also could choose `Numbering Scheme` to include section numbers, such as 1.1, 1.2, ...

  <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1oRClV4mqtZ262T3cdGP6lwH-EN26higz&sz=w1000" alt="Inspera Design" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

- Note that in the `Design` tab, you can see the total number of questions and maximum marks.

  This information is helpful if you wish to include the number of questions and total marks in the general instructions at the beginning of the exam.

- Developing new exam configurations can be a lengthy process, so please submit your request ahead of the deadline if possible. 





**Exercises**

- Assignment submission makes life easier for teachers. Easy grading.
- Quiz questions are better for students as they can practice digital exams and type math equations. Of course, they can write on papers on exams too. 





#### Question Types

<https://support.inspera.com/hc/en-us/sections/13367343277085-Question-types>

- Eassy

  Candidates can write longer texts with the opportunity to use formatting such as tables, <span style='color:#00CC66'>LaTex</span>, special symbols and mathematical symbols. 

- Text Area

  Candidates can write shorter text answers of the plain text type into a text area. This means that the candidates do **not** have the opportunity to, for example, make words bold, make bullet lists or insert tables, special characters or formulas. 

- Upload Assignment

  Candidate answers the prompt by uploading a file. This means that the candidate writes the answer in an external software, such as Excel or Word, and uploads the final answer as a file in the question.

  You can change the following options:

  - Prompt: Write an explanation text for the question. The text will appear in the workspace. "Upload your file here. Maximum one file." is set by default. 

  - File types:  Choose which file types should be allowed when uploading. 

    To customize which files types should be allowed, uncheck **Allow all files types** and select from the suggested file types or define custom file type.

- Programming



<a name="section-layout">**Section Layout**</a>

Section Layout can be used to alter how the Question Set is displayed for candidates. The default layout is one question per page. Optionally, section stimulus can be added, a one-page/text area that will appear to the left or at the top for each question in the section.

Q: What is <span style='color:#00CC66'>stimulus</span>?

A: A common text that is shown to all questions in the section.

Q: How to add stimulus?

A: Click “Create new Stimulus” $\rightarrow$ select “Document”. Then you can add text and/or images, just like an ordinary question.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=159_h1qOImXis4Prt0_o6MfWSj-oqvcRH&sz=w1000" alt="section layout" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

- "**Vertical layout**: With left stimulus" nice layout to show a common text to all questions in the section.

- The standard layout in Inspera Assessment is one page per question, but by clicking the open book in the section tools you can change it to “Vertical layout”. 

- Vertical layout means that all questions are shown on the same page. 

  Be advised that if you have created a large question set where some/all of the questions contain images and/or figures, using vertical layout may cause candidates to experience slowness in navigation.



Q: What is `non-marked document` type?

A: The question is used to provide candidates with <span style='color:#00CC66'>information</span>. It is visible to the candidates, but is not counted in the numbering for the questions. The question type Document is presented to the candidates, with an "i" in the upper left corner as well as in the bottom menu. 



Q: What is `non-marked form` type?

A: *Form* is a question type used as a questionnaire, so that the candidates can provide additional data (metadata) that the institution wants to collect. The purpose is mainly to gather information relevant to the submission, such as approval for publication, statements about the content, information about the candidates, etc. 



<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1Vk7YqfA_tn9TRrHS9SuTKQxpPsZwVTVB&sz=w1000" alt="question buttons" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:100%;" />

(1) Shows maximum marks for the question. If you click this button on an automatically marked question you will also see the marks for each wrong answer.

(2) Shows the labels you have used on the question.

(4) Allows you to move a question within the question set. Left click the crossing arrows, hold and drag the question to the desired location.

(5) Previews the question as seen by the candidate.

(6) Deletes the question from the question set. Note that the question is still available in the question bank.





Q: How to add attachments to questions?

A: When the question is viewed, the inserted file will be available for downloading via a link. You insert a file in a question by clicking the "Attach" icon (![img](https://inspera.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/57672789/image2015-11-30%2015:15:49.png?version=1&modificationDate=1448892950105&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)).

The co-examiner shall also participate in assessment of the examination response. If there are more than fifteen (15) responses, the co-examiner may assess a share of the responses.

4. The following constitute external grading:

   <ol type="a">
     <li>Participation in assessment of examination responses from all candidates; or </li>
     <li>Participation as an external programme supervisor. The Rector may determine guidelines for external programme supervisors. </li>

Nord webpage for "Grounds and Appeals":

<https://www.nord.no/en/student/examinations-and-assessment/grounds-and-appeals>

Won't see in Inspera, need to check [here](https://fsweb.no/fagpersonweb/) at <span style='color:#00CC66'>**Fagpersonweb**</span>.

Note that the candidates can ask for explanation/grounds of grades up to <u>one (1) week</u> after the grade has been published in Studentweb.

- For an oral examination or the assessment of practical skills, you must request grounds for grades immediately after the grade has been announced. 

___

Q: What is the deadline of providing an explanation?

A: Grounds should <span style='color:#00CC66'>normally</span> be given, either orally or in writing according to the examiner’s preference, within <span style='color:#00CC66'>two (2) weeks</span> of the demand.

___

Q: Who is responsible for drafting the grounds for determination of grade?

A: The <span style='color:#00CC66'>internal examiner</span> (i.e., course responsible) is responsible for preparing the explanation of grades. 

___

Q: Where to submit explanation?

A: In <span style='color:#00CC66'>Fagpersonweb</span>.



___

### **Appeals**

I need to do the following for external sensors

- send exam solutions to external sensors, and 
- send threshold values for marking, and orignal grades I gave;
  - Note that: <span style='color:#00CC66'>**Cannot be two or more grades**</span> different from the original marking. For instance, if I gave B, the external committee should give marks A-C, any more deviations will result in big troubles.
- remind them of deadlines and number of students who requested appeals? [Course responsible does NOT get notification when there are students appealing. Exam office send notifications directly to the appeal committee.]



<span style='color:#00CC66'>Klage Kommisjon</span> (Klagesensur)

The deadline for starting an appeal of grades is <u>three (3) weeks</u> after the grade has been announced in Studentweb. 

1. Klagesensur will get an email from Inspera when someone asks for re-grading. 

2. Logging in to Inspera to access to the submissions. Choose "Admin login", and log in using either:

   - ID-porten, i.e., Norwegian ID-number and a bank identificator, or 

   - Fiede, i.e., the university account

3. Marking the exam.

4. Contact the other sensor in the committee and reach an agreement before confirmation.

   - Q: Where to see the committee?

     A: See <a href="#committee">Here</a> .

___

Q: Can the course responsible know that students applied for appeals? (I might want to remind the Klagesensur.)

A: No. I don't get notifications for appeals. I only get notifications for explanations.

___

Q: How to resolve the appeals?

A: Klage committee (one internal + one external) steps in. Internal and external sensors must agree on the final grade. And their grade cannot be two or more grades different than the original grade.

___

Q: Deadline for provision of appeal results?

A: Regarding the marking deadline for appeals: There is NO specific marking deadline for appeals on grading, but we wish for the grading to be done as soon as possible. 



> There is just 2 things it is smart to be aware of:
>
> 1. The external “klagesensor” sometimes does not get notification about regrading. It is great that you let him know that some students want to have their exam re-graded.
> 2. Students can submit their requests for re-grading for 3 weeks after the initial grades are published. This means that one needs to check Inspera here-and-there to make sure that no new inquiries have arrived.



___

**Exam**

1. No embeded calculator in inspera.
2. Approved calculators: <https://www.nord.no/en/student/examinations-and-assessment/aids-for-written-on-site-examinations#approved-calculators>

Allowed aids: PC, pen, ruler, simple calculator and up to two bilingual dictionaries. 

Hjelpemidler: PC, penn, linjal, enkel kalkulator og inntil 2 stk tospråklige ordbøker.

___

Q: Where to set **threshold values** for grades?

A: Options $\rightarrow$ Settings  $\rightarrow$ Threshold values

___

### FAQ

Q: Is it possible to register only the school exam but not the home exam?  
A: Yes. 

> Det er mulig å melde seg opp til kun skoleeksamen, det kan være at siden dette er en sammensatt vurdering så blir en automatisk oppmeldt til begge vurderingene og så må man trekke seg fra den som ikke er aktuell.
>
> Hvis det er problemer med oppmelding etc så be ham ta kontakt med Gøran Jenssen.

## Parking

**Bodø - Free parking spaces will be reduced from 30 April 2024**

Nord University has had a lease agreement for free parking at the Police Academy, during the construction of Noatun.
This agreement ends on 30 April, and that part of the parking area will be charged.

Other parking areas - as at the student kindergarten and Mørkvedhallen are still free parking.

This means that from 30th April there will be fewer places with free parking.

The image below shows paid parking from 30/4 (orange strip) and free parking (green fields).
