**Apply for Vacation**

If one works 100% for a whole year, in this case, 2023, one is entitled to 25 days of paid vacation. This is calculated as approximately two days of paid vacation per month if one works 100%.

Let's say you started working 100% in June 2023; you would be entitled to approximately 13 days of paid vacation.

#### Tips

- Questions types:

  - Multiple Choice [#(MC): ~40]: save time for marking, but take lots of time to create the questions

  - Open Response [#(OR): 3-4]: save time for creating questions, but more time to mark, and more room for student argument.

- Save your edits frequently, especially when you insert images or type latex formulas! 

  No auto saving in Inspera.

- Leave Section 1 empty, saving it for the Cover Page.

- It is possible to add several <span style='color:#32CD32'>multiple choices</span> in one question to create a question set with sub-questions. Click `+Insert` to add alternative sets.

  Note that for <span style='color:#32CD32'>open response</span> questions, only one response field is allowed. So one question at a time. 

  It is possible to add a "Stimulus" on the left pane, and questions inn the right pane. The stimuli provides general info applicable to all question. While students scroll through the questions in the right pane, the stimulus remains constantly visible for reference. 

  Different layouts for stimulus and questions are available in "[Section Layout](#section-layout)".

  <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1riRy6NQogp2DMgs0s-S57ELH5IQi2_5d&sz=w1000" alt="Multiple Choice" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:60%;" />

  

- Create Tables in LatexiT, copy to png, save to loacal. Add table as png pictures. 

  - You can copy and paste tables from <span style='color:#32CD32'>Microsoft Word</span> to Inspera. 
  
    This feature is convenient as it is easier to edit tables in Word or Excel.
  
  - Inspera does NOT supoort html syntax; Canvas supports html.





**Appearance Design**

- Could choose for instance, whether to show TOC, hide question titles, ...

- Also could choose `Numbering Scheme` to include section numbers, such as 1.1, 1.2, ...

  <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1oRClV4mqtZ262T3cdGP6lwH-EN26higz&sz=w1000" alt="Inspera Design" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

- Note that in the `Design` tab, you can see the total number of questions and maximum marks.

  This information is helpful if you wish to include the number of questions and total marks in the general instructions at the beginning of the exam.

Access to required **software** for a new configuration

- Have to request a new exam configuration. 

- Developing new exam configurations can be a lengthy process, so please submit your request ahead of the deadline if possible.

**Appeals**

Students can request grounds for original grades up to **one week** after the grade has been published in Studentweb.

- For an oral examination or the assessment of practical skills, you must request grounds for grades immediately after the grade has been announced. 

Grounds should normally be given, either orally or in writing according to the examiner’s preference, within <span style='color:#32CD32'>two (2) weeks</span> of the demand.

The external examiner is responsible for preparing the explanation of grades. Explanations are to be given in Fagersonweb.

The deadline for an appeal of grades is <u>three (3) weeks</u> after the grade has been announced in Studentweb.

<https://support.inspera.com/hc/en-us/sections/13367343277085-Question-types>

- Eassy

  Candidates can write longer texts with the opportunity to use formatting such as tables, <span style='color:#32CD32'>LaTex</span>, special symbols and mathematical symbols. 

- Text Area

  Candidates can write shorter text answers of the plain text type into a text area. This means that the candidates do **not** have the opportunity to, for example, make words bold, make bullet lists or insert tables, special characters or formulas. 

- Upload Assignment

  Candidate answers the prompt by uploading a file. This means that the candidate writes the answer in an external software, such as Excel or Word, and uploads the final answer as a file in the question.

  You can change the following options:

  - Prompt: Write an explanation text for the question. The text will appear in the workspace. "Upload your file here. Maximum one file." is set by default. 

  - File types:  Choose which file types should be allowed when uploading. 

    To customize which files types should be allowed, uncheck **Allow all files types** and select from the suggested file types or define custom file type.

- Programming



<a name="section-layout">**Section Layout**</a>

Section Layout can be used to alter how the Question Set is displayed for candidates. The default layout is one question per page. Optionally, section stimulus can be added, a one-page/text area that will appear to the left or at the top for each question in the section.

Q: What is <span style='color:#32CD32'>stimulus</span>?

A: A common text that is shown to all questions in the section.

Q: How to add stimulus?

A: Click “Create new Stimulus” $\rightarrow$ select “Document”. Then you can add text and/or images, just like an ordinary question.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=159_h1qOImXis4Prt0_o6MfWSj-oqvcRH&sz=w1000" alt="section layout" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

- "**Vertical layout**: With left stimulus" nice layout to show a common text to all questions in the section.

- The standard layout in Inspera Assessment is one page per question, but by clicking the open book in the section tools you can change it to “Vertical layout”. 

- Vertical layout means that all questions are shown on the same page. 

  Be advised that if you have created a large question set where some/all of the questions contain images and/or figures, using vertical layout may cause candidates to experience slowness in navigation.



Q: What is `non-marked document` type?

A: The question is used to provide candidates with <span style='color:#32CD32'>information</span>. It is visible to the candidates, but is not counted in the numbering for the questions. The question type Document is presented to the candidates, with an "i" in the upper left corner as well as in the bottom menu. 



Q: What is `non-marked form` type?

A: *Form* is a question type used as a questionnaire, so that the candidates can provide additional data (metadata) that the institution wants to collect. The purpose is mainly to gather information relevant to the submission, such as approval for publication, statements about the content, information about the candidates, etc. 



<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1Vk7YqfA_tn9TRrHS9SuTKQxpPsZwVTVB&sz=w1000" alt="question buttons" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:100%;" />

(1) Shows maximum marks for the question. If you click this button on an automatically marked question you will also see the marks for each wrong answer.

(2) Shows the labels you have used on the question.

(3) Creates an identical copy of the question which can be retrieved from the question bank.

(4) Allows you to move a question within the question set. Left click the crossing arrows, hold and drag the question to the desired location.

(5) Previews the question as seen by the candidate.

(6) Deletes the question from the question set. Note that the question is still available in the question bank.





Q: How to add attachments to questions?

A: When the question is viewed, the inserted file will be available for downloading via a link. You insert a file in a question by clicking the "Attach" icon (![img](https://inspera.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/57672789/image2015-11-30%2015:15:49.png?version=1&modificationDate=1448892950105&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)).

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=19NoJqFl5dYhRNOiFTbm0PVkeuPtPRHRv&sz=w1000" alt="add attachment" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

The `File name` and `Link text` is then displayed. Make sure to quality assure the link text, as this is the text that will be viewable for the end user. 





### Home Assignment

- Need to be submitted in Inspera.

- Can write as a `.Rmd` file.

  `.Rmd` is useful when there is calculation involved.

  If there is no calculation, might as well use LaTeX as it is more flexible with typesetting.

### Parking

**Bodø - Free parking spaces will be reduced from 30 April 2024**

Nord University has had a lease agreement for free parking at the Police Academy, during the construction of Noatun.
This agreement ends on 30 April, and that part of the parking area will be charged.

Other parking areas - as at the student kindergarten and Mørkvedhallen are still free parking.

This means that from 30th April there will be fewer places with free parking.

The image below shows paid parking from 30/4 (orange strip) and free parking (green fields).
