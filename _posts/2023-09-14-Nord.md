Apply for Vacation

If one works 100% for a whole year, in this case, 2023, one is entitled to 25 days of paid vacation. This is calculated as approximately two days of paid vacation per month if one works 100%.

Let's say you started working 100% in June 2023; you would be entitled to approximately 13 days of paid vacation.

**Framework for teaching time**

- The core time for teaching is from Monday to Friday between 0815 to 1600.
- A lesson starts at quarter past the hour and lasts 45 minutes.
- For the best possible utilization of room capacity, the entire core time must be used. Teaching is normally planned in two-hour blocks.
- Teaching starts at 0815 in front of 0915 (which loses an hour from today's start).
- Teaching ends at 1600 before 1500 (which loses an hour from the end of the day).
- Starting at. From 14 to 16 on Wednesdays there are no lessons as a result of Student Democracy time. The only exceptions are: need for special rooms with limited capacity and experience-based master's degrees and assignment-based studies





- Check registered students, assessment, exam date.

- How to register exam and assignment.

  - Mind the deadline each year. Any changes regarding to assessment must be submitted before the start of the semester.

  - If there is any assignment, should let adm know the submission deadline. The deadline can be changed through the semester if needed. Workflow:

    Create the assignment in Inspera <u>one month</u> before the deadline $\rightarrow$ Share with Johanna $\rightarrow$ Exam office takes over $\rightarrow$ Students get access two weeks before the DDL $\rightarrow$ Students submit in Inspera



**Register textbook**

Canvas $\rightarrow$ Pensum list $\rightarrow$ open a new tab with **Leganto** system

What pct of a textbook can I distribute to my students for free? Fair use.

- Check with your librarian. They know it. About 20% (including index etc)

Workflow for Inspera Exam

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=18DOq-hvHFgs5urJJVHiNhnqXlkyuCSp_&sz=w1000" alt="Exam workflow" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:100%;" />



**Workflow**

1. Create Inspera assessment and share with the course assessor (Johanna); deadline: 2 weeks before the exam date;

2. **Examiner guidance** is to be uploaded to Inspera, this can be done after the submission deadline on the exam day. 
   - It should also be made available to students in Canvas. (cf. the examiner guidelines shall be available to students when examination results are published.)
3. Marking and grading need to be done no later than 3 weeks after the exam.



<u>After the exame date</u>, need to upload the solution (examiner guidance) on Inspera so that sensors get access and can start grading.



How to add examiner guidelines in Inspera:

- Open the "Grade" tab.
- Choose a topic.
- Click "Options" in the upper right corner.
- Click "Mark Scheme not found".
- Upload from computer.



Access to required **software** for a new configuration

- Have to request a new exam configuration. 

- Developing new exam configurations can be a lengthy process, so please submit your request ahead of the deadline if possible. 





Where to put grading scale criteria? For instance, A>90%, 75%<B≤90%, 55%<C≤75%, 45%<D≤55%, 35%<E≤45% and not passed is F ≤ 35%. 

After the exam, do the sensoring, do I need to export the grades from Inspera to Canvas for instance?



**Appeals**

Students can request grounds for original grades up to **one week** after the grade has been published in Studentweb.

- For an oral examination or the assessment of practical skills, you must request grounds for grades immediately after the grade has been announced. 

Grounds should normally be given, either orally or in writing according to the examiner’s preference, within two (2) weeks of the demand.

The external examiner is responsible for preparing the explanation of grades. Explanations are to be given in Fagersonweb.

The deadline for an appeal of grades is <u>three (3) weeks</u> after the grade has been announced in Studentweb. 



Tips

- Create Tables in LatexiT, save to pdf then convert to png. Add table as png.



**Exercises**

- Assignment submission makes life easier for teachers. Easy grading.
- Quiz questions are better for students as they can practice digital exams and type math equations. Of course, they can write on papers on exams too. 



**Create a question set**

1. Select **Question Sets** from the **Author** drop-down menu.
2. Click on the **Create new** button.
3. Enter the **name** of the set.



Question Types: <https://support.inspera.com/hc/en-us/sections/13367343277085-Question-types>

- Eassy

  Candidates can write longer texts with the opportunity to use formatting such as tables, LaTex, special symbols and mathematical symbols. 

- Text Area

  Candidates can write shorter text answers of the plain text type into a text area. This means that the candidates do **not** have the opportunity to, for example, make words bold, make bullet lists or insert tables, special characters or formulas. 

- Upload Assignment

  Candidate answers the prompt by uploading a file. This means that the candidate writes the answer in an external software, such as Excel or Word, and uploads the final answer as a file in the question.

  You can change the following options:

  - Prompt: Write an explanation text for the question. The text will appear in the workspace. "Upload your file here. Maximum one file." is set by default. 

  - File types:  Choose which file types should be allowed when uploading. 

    To customize which files types should be allowed, uncheck **Allow all files types** and select from the suggested file types or define custom file type.

- Programming



**Section Layout**

Section Layout can be used to alter how the Question Set is displayed for candidates. The default layout is one question per page. Optionally, section stimulus can be added, a one-page/text area that will appear to the left or at the top for each question in the section.

Q: What is <span style='color:#32CD32'>stimulus</span>?

A: A common text that is shown to all questions in the section.

Q: How to add stimulus?

A: Click “Create new Stimulus” $\rightarrow$ select “Document”. Then you can add text and/or images, just like an ordinary question.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=159_h1qOImXis4Prt0_o6MfWSj-oqvcRH&sz=w1000" alt="section layout" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

- "**Vertical layout**: With left stimulus" nice layout to show a common text to all questions in the section.

- The standard layout in Inspera Assessment is one page per question, but by clicking the open book in the section tools you can change it to “Vertical layout”. 

- Vertical layout means that all questions are shown on the same page. 

  Be advised that if you have created a large question set where some/all of the questions contain images and/or figures, using vertical layout may cause candidates to experience slowness in navigation.



Q: What is `non-marked document` type?

A: The question is used to provide candidates with <span style='color:#32CD32'>information</span>. It is visible to the candidates, but is not counted in the numbering for the questions. The question type Document is presented to the candidates, with an "i" in the upper left corner as well as in the bottom menu. 



Q: What is `non-marked form` type?

A: *Form* is a question type used as a questionnaire, so that the candidates can provide additional data (metadata) that the institution wants to collect. The purpose is mainly to gather information relevant to the submission, such as approval for publication, statements about the content, information about the candidates, etc. 



<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1Vk7YqfA_tn9TRrHS9SuTKQxpPsZwVTVB&sz=w1000" alt="question buttons" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:100%;" />

(1) Shows maximum marks for the question. If you click this button on an automatically marked question you will also see the marks for each wrong answer.

(2) Shows the labels you have used on the question.

(3) Creates an identical copy of the question which can be retrieved from the question bank.

(4) Allows you to move a question within the question set. Left click the crossing arrows, hold and drag the question to the desired location.

(5) Previews the question as seen by the candidate.

(6) Deletes the question from the question set. Note that the question is still available in the question bank.





Q: How to add attachments to questions?

A: When the question is viewed, the inserted file will be available for downloading via a link. You insert a file in a question by clicking the "Attach" icon (![img](https://inspera.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/57672789/image2015-11-30%2015:15:49.png?version=1&modificationDate=1448892950105&cacheVersion=1&api=v2)).

### Parking

**Bodø - Free parking spaces will be reduced from 30 April 2024**

Nord University has had a lease agreement for free parking at the Police Academy, during the construction of Noatun.
This agreement ends on 30 April, and that part of the parking area will be charged.

Other parking areas - as at the student kindergarten and Mørkvedhallen are still free parking.

This means that from 30th April there will be fewer places with free parking.

The image below shows paid parking from 30/4 (orange strip) and free parking (green fields).
