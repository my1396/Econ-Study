**How to organize a meeting**

1. Talk to people in general, spreading the words. It's like the willingness survey. See how people react and if they are willing to join.

   You will get some idea about how to organize it, when, where (physical or online).

2. Send out information: A meeting is on the way

   More information will come soon

3. Talk to more people, ask when they are available and if they can make it

4. Send out actual invitaiton

   Physical, make a room reservation

5. With digital possibility maybe.

<span style='color:#00CC66'>**Apply for Vacation**</span>

Use [DFØ-portal](https://selvbetjening.dfo.no/sap/bc/ui5_ui5/ui2/ushell/shells/abap/fiorilaunchpad.html?sap-language=EN#Shell-home) and submit an absence request.

If one works 100% for a whole year, in this case, 2023, one is entitled to 25 days of paid vacation. This is calculated as approximately two days of paid vacation per month if one works 100%.

Let's say you started working 100% in June 2023; you would be entitled to approximately 13 days of paid vacation.

Q: How to register a request for vacation?  
A: DFØ → request for absence → create request → Leave type (Holiday with pay)

- Set out-of-office messages on eamil and Teams
- place a notice on the office door.

Summer vacation: most people start in week 28, take 3 weeks off.

Two types of vacations

- Betalt Ferie: 25 days paid holiday leave; ← regular holiday one should apply;
- Velderdpermisjoner: 12 days paid compassionate leave; ← in connection with unforeseen events, e.g., for children's transition to daycare or after-school (SFO) facilities; children's first day of school; medical treatment;

- Teaching starts at 0815 in front of 0915 (which loses an hour from today's start).
- Teaching ends at 1600 before 1500 (which loses an hour from the end of the day).
- Starting at. From 14 to 16 on Wednesdays there are no lessons as a result of Student Democracy time. The only exceptions are: need for special rooms with limited capacity and experience-based master's degrees and assignment-based studies

### **Appeals**

**Exam Regulations**: <https://www.nord.no/en/student/examinations-and-assessment/grading>

**Grading**: <https://www.nord.no/en/student/examinations-and-assessment/grading>

I need to do the following for external sensors

- send exam solutions to external sensors, and 
- send threshold values for marking, and orignal grades I gave;
  - Note that: <span style='color:#00CC66'>**Cannot be two or more grades**</span> different from the original marking. For instance, if I gave B, the external committee should give marks A-C, any more deviations will result in big troubles.
- remind them of deadlines and number of students who requested appeals? [Course responsible does NOT get notification when there are students appealing. Exam office send notifications directly to the appeal committee.]



<span style='color:#00CC66'>Klage Kommisjon</span> (Klagesensur)

One internal + external examiners

Q: Can someone who is teaching the course also be the internal examiner? 

Appeal examiner / accessor

The deadline for starting an appeal of grades is <u>three (3) weeks</u> after the grade has been announced in Studentweb. 

1. Klagesensur will get an email from Inspera when someone asks for re-grading. 

2. Logging in to Inspera to access to the submissions. Choose "Admin login", and log in using either:

   - ID-porten, i.e., Norwegian ID-number and a bank identificator, or 

   - Fiede, i.e., the university account

3. Marking the exam.

4. Contact the other sensor in the committee and reach an agreement before confirmation.

   - Q: Where to see the committee?

     A: See <a href="#committee">Here</a> .

___

Q: Can the course responsible know that students applied for appeals? (I might want to remind the Klagesensur.)

A: No. I don't get notifications for appeals. I only get notifications for explanations.

___

Q: How to resolve the appeals?

A: Klage committee (one internal + one external) steps in. Internal and external sensors must agree on the final grade. And their grade cannot be <span style='color:#008B45'>**two or more**</span> grades different than the original grade. If so, a further assessment is made before the final grade is determined.

The examiners for the ordinary examination and for the reassessment will conduct the assessment jointly. (cf §11-2 Appealing a grade)

___

Q: Deadline for provision of appeal results?

A: Regarding the marking deadline for appeals: There is NO specific marking deadline for appeals on grading, but we wish for the grading to be done as soon as possible. 



> There is just 2 things it is smart to be aware of:
>
> 1. The external “klagesensor” sometimes does not get notification about regrading. It is great that you let him know that some students want to have their exam re-graded.
> 2. Students can submit their requests for re-grading for 3 weeks after the initial grades are published. This means that one needs to check Inspera here-and-there to make sure that no new inquiries have arrived.

### FAQ

Q: Is it possible to register only the school exam but not the home exam?  
A: Yes. 

> Det er mulig å melde seg opp til kun skoleeksamen, det kan være at siden dette er en sammensatt vurdering så blir en automatisk oppmeldt til begge vurderingene og så må man trekke seg fra den som ikke er aktuell.
>
> Hvis det er problemer med oppmelding etc så be ham ta kontakt med Gøran Jenssen.

## Parking

**Bodø - Free parking spaces will be reduced from 30 April 2024**

Nord University has had a lease agreement for free parking at the Police Academy, during the construction of Noatun.
This agreement ends on 30 April, and that part of the parking area will be charged.

Other parking areas - as at the student kindergarten and Mørkvedhallen are still free parking.

This means that from 30th April there will be fewer places with free parking.

The image below shows paid parking from 30/4 (orange strip) and free parking (green fields).
