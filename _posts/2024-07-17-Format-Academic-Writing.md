## **Math Symbols & Equations**

- **<span style='color:#32CD32'>A space</span> should be placed between the numerical value and the unit symbol.** 

  数字和单位之间需要加空格！例外：百分号，摄氏度。

  For example, 1.2 dB is correct, while 1.2dB is not. 

  If you are writing in LaTeX, I recommend you use the siunitx by `\usepackage{siunitx}`. The command `\SI{<value>}{<unit>}` automatically prints the space between the numerical value and the unit symbol. 

  E.g., 3 g, 6 cm, 6 days, 7 years.

  **Exceptions** for percentage and temperatures. 10% and 17ºC. They don't need a space between numbers and units.

- **Physical units must not be italicized.** For example, 1.2 dB is correct, while 1.2 *dB* is not.

- There should be a space before and after arithematic operators. E.g., 2.5 ± 0.07. 

- When to spell out numbers?

  - when the number is less than 10, then it should be spelled out; 10 以上的数字要拼写。
  - when numbers appear in the beginning of a sentence. 以数字开头的句子，数字要拼写出来。

- Decades are written in numerals without an apostrophe: 1970s. 年份都是用numerals.



Some math style conventions

- Variables should always be set in ***italic*** in both text and in equations.
- Vectors should be in **bold** type.
- Functions should be as roman type. E.g., $\exp, \ln, \arg$.
- If you need to break one long expression, the math operator such as `+` should be on the next line.





## Bullet points

For a list that contains full sentences:

- Always use a lead-in line, ending with a colon.  开头的介绍要以冒号结尾。
- Ensure that each bullet item is a full sentence.  每个点是句子的时候要<span style='color:#32CD32'>大写首字母</span>，且以<span style='color:#32CD32'>句号结尾</span>。
- Start each bullet item (sentence) with an uppercase letter.
- Use a full stop at the end of each bullet item.

For a list whose bullet points are not full sentences:

- introduce the list with a lead-in line (that ends with a colon)
- ensure that each bullet point makes sense reading on from the lead-in line
- use a consistent form/structure for each bullet point
- start each bullet point with a lowercase letter  每个点不是完整句子的时候，<span style='color:#32CD32'>首字母小写</span>，<span style='color:#32CD32'>结尾不加标点</span>
- omit punctuation at the end of individual bullet points, including the last  即使最后一个点也不加标点！





**Comma**

Use a comma (often called a “serial comma” or “Oxford comma”) before the final “and” in a list of three or more items.



**Ellipsis**

- Use a space both before and after an ellipsis. 

- Do not add a full stop if the ellipsis ends a sentence.

- Preceding punctuation can be omitted, unless needed for comprehension (e.g. a question mark or exclamation mark).
