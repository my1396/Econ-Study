-   <span style='color:#32CD32'>**Read the sign**</span>
    -   thick stubby lines are for dual carriageways;
    -   two thick lines side-by-side: 1st one is exit, 2nd one is entrance; sometimes the exit is a longer line, entrance is a shorter line; you should ignore the second short line;
    -   Gap indicates the exit before it is the last exit before coming back on ourselves (U-turn).

-   Don't go on the bridge and do not exit the dual carriageway too early (wait for the arrow indicating exit, the first exit is for turning left). Go on the bridge meaning you are staying on the dual carriageway.

- Having exited from the By-pass, take the <span style='color:#32CD32'>right hand lane</span> approaching.

- Turning right, <span style='color:#32CD32'>4th Exit, taking the <u>middle lane</u></span> on the roundabout, indicate right.

  - Entering: right lane;

  - On the roundabout: after passing the <span style='color:#32CD32'>1st exit</span>, right lane will split into middle and right lanes. Choose the <span style='color:#32CD32'>middle lane</span> to follow through;

- **1st Exit**

  You could take either the middle or the right lane. [just go with the middle lane]

  -   middle lane is easier, it takes you right to the left lane as you exit;
  -   right lane is trickier, the lane split into two, and you have to maneuver to the middle one; and you exit onto the right lane at your exit, and you need an additonal lane changing to the left.

- Entering: right lane;

  - note that lanes are quite narrow, have to <span style='color:#32CD32'>stick to the right curb</span>.

    -   make your car curved;

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/image-20221221111523671.png" alt="image-20221221111523671" style="zoom:50%;" />

    -   left lane: retail park, ring road (S);
    -   right lane split to mid lane: CLEY;
    -   right lane: ring road (N);

- On the roundabout: right lane;

- Just when you enter under the bridge, your lane split into two lanes;

  - choose the <span style='color:#32CD32'>middle lane</span> to follow through; so that when you passing the Cowley (penultimate) exit, you will be taken to the left lane;

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/image-20221220212342424.png" alt="image-20221220212342424" style="zoom:50%;" />


- After passing the Cowley exit, check mirrors and indicate left, exit to Ring Road North on the <span style='color:#32CD32'>left lane (if going from middle lane)</span>;

- Note that you are on a slip road now with a speed limit 50m/h, you have to <span style='color:#32CD32'>accelerate a lot</span>! So when you join the dual carriageway, you have built up your speed.

  - going too slow on slip road is dangerous–when you join the dual carriageways, you are slowing down the traffic and risk tail crashing.

  - you must not change lane on slip roads, you have to wait until the end of slip roads and merge to the right to dual carriageways;
