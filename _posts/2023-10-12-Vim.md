### **Copy from vim to clipboard**

You may be familiar with the `yank` command: `y` to copy selected text, `yy` to copy the current line. To <span style='color:chartreuse'>copy to the system clipboard</span>, we'll use the same command with a few extras modifier to select the correct <span style='color:chartreuse'>register</span>.

1.   Choosing a register
     In Vim, you choose a register using `"`.

2.   The system register
     For both Mac and Windows, you can select the system register by using `*`.

3.   Putting it all together
     Enter visual mode by hitting `v`. Select the text you want to copy, then type: `"*y`



### **Block comment**

Method 2 â€“ Visual Mode

The other method you can use to comment out multiple lines is to use Visual Mode.

To do this, press ESC and navigate to the lines you want to comment out.

-   Press CTRL + V to enable Visual Mode.
    -   Using the up and down arrow key, highlight the lines you wish to comment out.

-   Once you have the lines selected, press the SHIFT + I keys to enter insert mode.

-   Enter your command symbol, for example, # sign, and press the ESC key. Vim will comment out all the highlighted lines.
