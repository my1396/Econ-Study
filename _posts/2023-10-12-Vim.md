## Copy from Vim to Clipboard on Mac

You may be familiar with the `yank` command: `y` to copy selected text, `yy` to copy the current line. It copies stuff to Vim's internal buffer. I want to copy in Vim and paste to other apps using cmd-C.

To <span style='color:#32CD32'>copy to the system clipboard</span>, we'll use the same command with a few extras modifier to select the correct <span style='color:#32CD32'>register</span>.

1.   Choosing a register
     In Vim, you choose a register using `"`.
2.   The system register
     For both Mac and Windows, you can select the system register by using `+`.
3.   Putting it all together
     Enter visual mode by hitting `v` (or `V` if you want to select by lines). Select the text you want to copy, if you want to select til the end of line, press `$`, then type: <span style='color:#00CC66'>`"+y`</span>, it means "copy the selected text into the system register `+`".

## Configuration

`:set list` enable list mode; show whitespace chars. 

Use [`:hlep 'listchars'`](https://vimhelp.org/options.txt.html#%27listchars%27) to show what the strings mean. To summarize it here:

- `tab`: displayed as`^I` (`ctrl-I`)
- `eol`: end of line, default `$`
- `trail`: trailing spaces
- `space`: space.
- `nbsp`: non-breakable space

`:set nolist` hide whitespace chars

`:set listchars=option1:char1,option2:char2,...`  configures the characters used to represent invisible characters when the `list` option is enabled. This allows for visual identification of elements like tabs, trailing spaces, and end-of-line markers.

- `charx`: the characters used to display the original whitespace characters.

  The characters ':' and ',' should not be used.  UTF-8 characters can be used when 'encoding' is "utf-8", otherwise only printable characters are allowed.  All characters must be single width.

  Each character can be specified as hex. 

  ```bash
  set listchars=eol:\\x24
  set listchars=eol:\\u21b5
  set listchars=eol:\\U000021b5
  ```

  **Note** that a double backslash is used.  The number of hex characters must be exactly 2 for `\\x`, 4 for `\\u` and 8 for `\\U`.

  Examples: 

  ```bash
  :set lcs=tab:>-,trail:-
  :set lcs=tab:>-,eol:<,nbsp:%
  :set lcs=extends:>,precedes:<
  ```



Debian requires files to end with a newline character `<EOL>`.

## FAQ

Q: What is visual mode?  
A: It's like selection using keyboard, instead of a cursor. The selected part will be highlighted.

Q: How to enter visual mode?  
A: Press `v` to start from your cursor, `V` for single-line, and `ctrl+V` for multiple-line, i.e., visual block mode. 

Q: How to cut entire line and paste to another place?  
A: Press `dd` to cut, go to the place where you want to insert, press `P` (uppercase). The current line will move down by one line. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Delete to the beginning or end of file

- Delete to the beginning of the file

  `:1,.d`

  That command can be read as “From line 1 to the current position, delete”, or if you prefer, “Delete from line 1 to the current line position.”

- Delete to the end of the file

  `:.,$d`

  That command can be read as “From the current position to the end of file, delete.”



Q: How to Undo and Redo?  
A: In command mode, 

- use `u` (lowercase) or `:undo` key to Undo
  - Hit `u` multiple times will redo recursively
- `ctrl`+`r`  or `:redo` to Redo.

Tip:

- You can undo multiple changes, `[number]u`. For example, `2u` will undo the last 2 changes.



Using a Count to Repeat Commands

Many vi commands can be preceded by a repeat factor (called a **count**)—a number that precedes the command and tells it how many times to repeat the operation.

For example,  `3dd` repeats the command to delete a line three times, therefore deleting three lines. `2dw` deletes two words, and `4x` deletes four characters or spaces.



Using a period (`.`) to repeat the previous text-changing command.

For example, if you have just deleted a line with `dd`, you can move the cursor to another line and delete it by simply typing a period.

## Block comment

Q: How to indent a block by 2 spaces?  
A: Enter **Visual Line mode** (<kbd>⇧V</kbd>) → Select your lines → Enter colon (`:`), `'<,'>` will auto add, which means for the selected lines → Type <span style='color:#008B45'>`norm I<space><space>`</span> (norm, space, capital I, two spaces)→ Hit Enter.

Break down the command:

- `:'<,'>`: for the lines I selected
- `norm`:  Execute the following sequence of keystrokes as if I was in normal mode
- `I`: Insert at the beginning of the line the following characters
- `<space>`: The character(s) you would like to insert

Another option: use [`AlignFromCursor`](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4155) plugin.

Tip:

- When in Visual Line mode ( `⇧V`), select the block , hit (`Tab`) will indent the block by 4 spaces.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Method 2 – **Visual Block Mode** (<kbd>^V</kbd>)

The other method you can use to comment out multiple lines is to use Visual Block Mode.

To do this, press ESC and navigate to the lines you want to comment out.

-   Press <code>CTRL</code> + <code>V</code> to enable Visual Block Mode.

    -   Using the up and down arrow key, highlight the lines you wish to comment out.
-   Once you have the lines selected, press the `SHIFT` + `I` keys to enter insert mode.
-   Enter your command symbol, for example, # sign, and press the ESC key. Vim will comment out all the highlighted lines.



How to remove first `;` of the selected lines?

```
;extension=php_bz2.dll
;extension=php_curl.dll
;extension=php_fileinfo.dll
;extension=php_ftp.dll
```

1. Place cursor on first or last `;`
2. Press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code> to enter Visual Block mode
3. Use arrow keys or j, k to select the `;` characters you want to delete (or the other "*first few characters*")
4. Press <code>X</code> to delete them all at once

This approach can be used to unindent multiple lines as well.

<!--- add two spaces -->
My line of text<space><space>
[Name of link](url)
<!--- or add one blackslash -->
My line of text\
[Name of link](url)
```

**Regular expression**

Regex 正则表达式

Short totorial: <https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Regexe.html>

The `[...]`, known as *character class* (or *bracket list*), encloses a list of characters. It matches any SINGLE character in the list. In this example, `[0-9]` matches any SINGLE character between 0 and 9 (i.e., a digit), where dash (`-`) denotes the *range*.

| Symbol     | Meaning                                                      | Example                                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `*`        | the preceding character can occur 0 or more times.           | `meo*w` will match `mew`, `meow`, `meooow`, and `meoooooooooooow`. <br />`[0-9]*`  matches zero or more digits. It accepts all those in `[0-9]+` plus the empty string. |
| `+`        | the preceding character can occur 1 or more times.           | `meo+w` will match `meow`, `meooow`, and `meoooooooooooow`, but not match `mew`.<br />`[0-9]+` matches one or more digits such as `123`, `000`. |
| `.`        | any character                                                | `.*` means zero or more of any character.                    |
| `[A-Za-z]` | all letters *(uppercase and lowercase)*                      |                                                              |
| `{m}`      | repetition indicator, meaning the preceding character can repeat exactly `m` times |                                                              |
| `{m,}`     | the preceding character can repeat  `m` or more times        |                                                              |
| `{m,n}`    | the preceding character can repeat `m` to `n` times, inclusive |                                                              |
| `^`        | start-of-line                                                |                                                              |
| `$`        | end-of-line                                                  | `^[0-9]+$` matches a numeric string.                         |

## Plugin Manager

[`vim-plug`](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug?tab=readme-ov-file) is a popular plugin manager for Vim.

Install `vim-plug` by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

Usage

Add a vim-plug section to your `~/.vimrc`

1. Begin the section with `call plug#begin()`
2. List the plugins with `Plug` commands
3. End the section with `call plug#end()`

```vim
call plug#begin()

" List your plugins here
Plug 'tpope/vim-sensible'

call plug#end()
```

Reload the file or restart Vim, then you can,

- `:PlugInstall` to install the plugins
- `:PlugUpdate` to install or update the plugins
- `:PlugDiff` to review the changes from the last update
- `:PlugClean` to remove plugins no longer in the list

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Install `editorconfig-vim`

This plugin is used to **configure file format** and **maintain consistent coding styles** for shared projects across various editors and IDEs. It enables editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. 

For instance, when you save a file in BBEdit, it will automatically convert line endings to `LF` (Unix style) and remove trailing spaces, ensuring consistency across different editors.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1IPlu3w3LXyqnYCDsbSjABTWZksDK4Y3a&sz=w1000" alt="file format.png" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

How to install:

1. Add to your `.vimrc` in your plugin section:

   ```vim
   Plug 'editorconfig/editorconfig-vim'
   ```

2. Save the `.vimrc` file with the command `:w`.

3. Source your `.vimrc` by calling `:source $MYVIMRC`.

   Replace `$MYVIMRC` with your `.vimrc` path, defaults to `~/.vimrc`.

4. Then call `:PlugInstall`.


**Configuration**

When opening a file, EditorConfig plugins look for a file named `.editorconfig` (all lowercase) in the directory of the opened file and in every parent directory. A search for `.editorconfig` files will stop if the root filepath is reached or an EditorConfig file with `root=true` is found.


[Example `~/.editorconfig` file:](https://editorconfig.org)

```ini
# top-most EditorConfig file
root = true

# Default settings for all files
[*]
indent_style = space                # Use spaces for indentation
indent_size = 2                     # Set indentation size to 2 spaces
end_of_line = lf                    # Use Unix-style line endings (LF)
charset = utf-8                     # Set file encoding to UTF-8
trim_trailing_whitespace = true     # Remove any whitespace at the end of lines
insert_final_newline = true         # Ensure file ends with a newline

# Override for Markdown files
[*.md]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4

# Override for HTML and CSS files
[*.{html,css}]
indent_style = space                # Use spaces for indentation
indent_size = 2                     # Set indentation size to 2 spaces
```


[`editorconfig-vim` guidelines:](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/Plugin-Guidelines)

- `end_of_line` property can be set to "CR", "LF", or "CRLF" (case insensitive) to set line-ending style.

  - `lf`: Unix style: `\n` (`:set ff=unix` force vim to **set file format**, line endings will change accordingly)
  - `crlf`: Windows dos style: `\r\n` (`:fileformat=dos`)
  - `cr`: old Mac style: `\r` (`:set ff=mac`)

  What `editorconfig-vim` does when you open or save files:

  - When opening/switching to a file, apply built-in editor setting. In some editors, this will mark the file as dirty.
  - If no built-in editor setting, apply built-in editor operation on file save.
  - If no built-in editor operation, apply manual operation on file save or do nothing.

  In plain language, if your editor can’t do that automatically, it will fix the line endings when you save.
