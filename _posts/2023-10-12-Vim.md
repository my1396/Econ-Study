### **Copy from Vim to Clipboard on Mac**

You may be familiar with the `yank` command: `y` to copy selected text, `yy` to copy the current line. It copies stuff to Vim's internal buffer. I want to conpy in Vim and paste to other apps using cmd-C.

To <span style='color:#32CD32'>copy to the system clipboard</span>, we'll use the same command with a few extras modifier to select the correct <span style='color:#32CD32'>register</span>.

1.   Choosing a register
     In Vim, you choose a register using `"`.
2.   The system register
     For both Mac and Windows, you can select the system register by using `+`.
3.   Putting it all together
     Enter visual mode by hitting `v` (or `V` if you want to select by lines). Select the text you want to copy, if you want to select til the end of line, press `$`, then type: <span style='color:#00CC66'>`"+y`</span>, it means "copy the selected text into the system register `+`".

### FAQ

Q: What is visual mode?  
A: It's like selection using keyboard, instead of a cursor. The selected part will be highlighted.

Q: How to enter visual mode?  
A: Press `v` to start from your cursor, `V` for single-line, and `ctrl+V` for multiple-line, i.e., visual block mode. 

Q: How to cut entire line and paste to another place?  
A: Press `dd` to cut, go to the place where you want to insert, press `P` (uppercase). The current line will move down by one line. 

Q: How to indent a block by 2 spaces?  
A: Enter visual mode (⇧V) → Select your lines → Enter colon (`:`), `'<,'>` will auto add, which means for the selected lines → Type <span style='color:#008B45'>`norm I<space><space>`</span> (norm, space, capital I, two spaces)→ Hit Enter.

Break down the command:

- `:'<,'>`: for the lines I selected
- `norm`:  Execute the following sequence of keystrokes as if I was in normal mode
- `I`: Insert at the beginning of the line the following characters
- `<space>`: The character(s) you would like to insert

Another option: use [`AlignFromCursor`](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4155) plugin.

Tip:

- When in Visual mode ( `⇧V`), select the block , hit (`⇧>`) will indent the block by 4 spaces.



Delete to the beginning or end of file

- Delete to the beginning of the file

  `:1,.d`

  That command can be read as “From line 1 to the current position, delete”, or if you prefer, “Delete from line 1 to the current line position.”

- Delete to the end of the file

  `:.,$d`

  That command can be read as “From the current position to the end of file, delete.”



Q: How to Undo and Redo?  
A: In command mode, 

- use `u` (lowercase) or `:undo` key to Undo
  - Hit `u` multiple times will redo recursively
- `ctrl`+`r`  or `:redo` to Redo.

Tip:

- You can undo multiple changes, `[number]u`. For example, `2u` will undo the last 2 changes.



Using a Count to Repeat Commands

Many vi commands can be preceded by a repeat factor (called a **count**)—a number that precedes the command and tells it how many times to repeat the operation.

For example,  `3dd` repeats the command to delete a line three times, therefore deleting three lines. `2dw` deletes two words, and `4x` deletes four characters or spaces.



Using a period (`.`) to repeat the previous text-changing command.

For example, if you have just deleted a line with `dd`, you can move the cursor to another line and delete it by simply typing a period.

### **Block comment**

Method 2 – Visual Mode

The other method you can use to comment out multiple lines is to use Visual Mode.

To do this, press ESC and navigate to the lines you want to comment out.

-   Press <code>CTRL</code> + <code>V</code> to enable Visual Block Mode.

    -   Using the up and down arrow key, highlight the lines you wish to comment out.
-   Once you have the lines selected, press the `SHIFT` + `I` keys to enter insert mode.
-   Enter your command symbol, for example, # sign, and press the ESC key. Vim will comment out all the highlighted lines.



How to remove first `;` of the selected lines?

```
;extension=php_bz2.dll
;extension=php_curl.dll
;extension=php_fileinfo.dll
;extension=php_ftp.dll
```

1. Place cursor on first or last `;`
2. Press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>V</code> to enter Visual Block mode
3. Use arrow keys or j, k to select the `;` characters you want to delete (or the other "*first few characters*")
4. Press <code>X</code> to delete them all at once



How to insert soft line break?
```markdown

```



**Regular expression**

Regex 正则表达式

Short totorial: <https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Regexe.html>

The `[...]`, known as *character class* (or *bracket list*), encloses a list of characters. It matches any SINGLE character in the list. In this example, `[0-9]` matches any SINGLE character between 0 and 9 (i.e., a digit), where dash (`-`) denotes the *range*.

| Symbol     | Meaning                                                      | Example                                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `*`        | the preceding character can occur 0 or more times.           | `meo*w` will match `mew`, `meow`, `meooow`, and `meoooooooooooow`. <br />`[0-9]*`  matches zero or more digits. It accepts all those in `[0-9]+` plus the empty string. |
| `+`        | the preceding character can occur 1 or more times.           | `meo+w` will match `meow`, `meooow`, and `meoooooooooooow`, but not match `mew`.<br />`[0-9]+` matches one or more digits such as `123`, `000`. |
| `.`        | any character                                                | `.*` means zero or more of any character.                    |
| `[A-Za-z]` | all letters *(uppercase and lowercase)*                      |                                                              |
| `{m}`      | repetition indicator, meaning the preceding character can repeat exactly `m` times |                                                              |
| `{m,}`     | the preceding character can repeat  `m` or more times        |                                                              |
| `{m,n}`    | the preceding character can repeat `m` to `n` times, inclusive |                                                              |
| `^`        | start-of-line                                                |                                                              |
| `$`        | end-of-line                                                  | `^[0-9]+$` matches a numeric string.                         |
