### **Copy from Vim to Clipboard on Mac**

You may be familiar with the `yank` command: `y` to copy selected text, `yy` to copy the current line. It copies stuff to Vim's internal buffer. I want to conpy in Vim and paste to other apps using cmd-C.

To <span style='color:#32CD32'>copy to the system clipboard</span>, we'll use the same command with a few extras modifier to select the correct <span style='color:#32CD32'>register</span>.

1.   Choosing a register
     In Vim, you choose a register using `"`.
2.   The system register
     For both Mac and Windows, you can select the system register by using `+`.
3.   Putting it all together
     Enter visual mode by hitting `v` (or `V` if you want to select by lines). Select the text you want to copy, if you want to select til the end of line, press `$`, then type: <span style='color:#00CC66'>`"+y`</span>, it means "copy the selected text into the system register `+`".

### FAQ

Q: What is visual mode?  
A: It's like selection using keyboard, instead of a cursor. The selected part will be highlighted.

Q: How to enter visual mode?  
A: Press `v` to start from your cursor, `V` for single-line, and `ctrl+V` for multiple-line, i.e., visual block mode. 

Q: How to cut entire line and paste to another place?  
A: Press `dd` to cut, go to the place where you want to insert, press `P` (uppercase). The current line will move down by one line.

### **Block comment**

Method 2 – Visual Mode

The other method you can use to comment out multiple lines is to use Visual Mode.

To do this, press ESC and navigate to the lines you want to comment out.

-   Press CTRL + V to enable Visual Mode.

    -   Using the up and down arrow key, highlight the lines you wish to comment out.
-   Once you have the lines selected, press the SHIFT + I keys to enter insert mode.
-   Enter your command symbol, for example, # sign, and press the ESC key. Vim will comment out all the highlighted lines.

**Regular expression**

Regex 正则表达式

Short totorial: <https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Regexe.html>

The `[...]`, known as *character class* (or *bracket list*), encloses a list of characters. It matches any SINGLE character in the list. In this example, `[0-9]` matches any SINGLE character between 0 and 9 (i.e., a digit), where dash (`-`) denotes the *range*.

| Symbol     | Meaning                                                      | Example                                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `*`        | the preceding character can occur 0 or more times.           | `meo*w` will match `mew`, `meow`, `meooow`, and `meoooooooooooow`. <br />`[0-9]*`  matches zero or more digits. It accepts all those in `[0-9]+` plus the empty string. |
| `+`        | the preceding character can occur 1 or more times.           | `meo+w` will match `meow`, `meooow`, and `meoooooooooooow`, but not match `mew`.<br />`[0-9]+` matches one or more digits such as `123`, `000`. |
| `.`        | any character                                                | `.*` means zero or more of any character.                    |
| `[A-Za-z]` | all letters *(uppercase and lowercase)*                      |                                                              |
| `{m}`      | repetition indicator, meaning the preceding character can repeat exactly `m` times |                                                              |
| `{m,}`     | the preceding character can repeat  `m` or more times        |                                                              |
| `{m,n}`    | the preceding character can repeat `m` to `n` times, inclusive |                                                              |
| `^`        | start-of-line                                                |                                                              |
| `$`        | end-of-line                                                  | `^[0-9]+$` matches a numeric string.                         |
