### Tax deduction

<https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/taxes/get-the-taxes-right/property-and-belongings/houses-property-and-plots-of-land/jointly-owned-property/>

You’re entitled to deductions for your share of the expenses in the housing association/housing company/jointly owned property. Your share of the expenses should be included in the annual statement.
The deduction is usually pre-filled in your tax return.

Felleskostnader av borrettslag, kan jeg få fradrag for dette.

> If you have expenses in connection with your shares in housing cooperatives and/or jointly owned property, you can get a deduction for this. 

Det er først og fremst sameiers/andelshavers andel av sameiets/boligselskapets rentekostnader som skal fradragsføres. 

>It is primarily the co-owner's share of interest costs incurred by the joint property ownership/housing co-operative which is to be entered as a deduction in the tax return.

Q: How to enter this in my tax return?

A: The item will normally be pre-completed with the amount for your share of the expenses of the housing cooperative/jointly owned property. The amount(s) will be based on what has been reported by the housing cooperative/jointly owned property, so you should **check that everything is correct**.

The amounts you should perform the check against will be shown in the annual statement you receive from the housing cooperative/jointly owned property in **January**. If the amount shown is wrong, you must change it in the tax return. You should contact the housing cooperative/jointly owned property to ensure that the annual statement is correct.

Tax return: applies to last year, submit in April. Your summary of income, deductions, wealth, debt and what you have paid in tax during the past year. I have to check that all the info is correct.
