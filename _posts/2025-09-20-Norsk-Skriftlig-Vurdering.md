## B2 criteria for norskprøven – skriftlig framstilling

This summary is based directly on the official **vurderingsskjema for norskprøven (B1–B2)** and explains what is required to be assessed at **B2 level**, especially what separates B2 from B1.



## 1. Task achievement and content (Formidling)

At **B2**, you must:

- Answer the task **clearly and precisely**
- Stay **relevant** to what the task asks
- **Express and justify viewpoints** clearly
- **Argue** in a mostly logical and coherent way
- Show ability to **reflect and generalize**, not only describe personal experience

For the B1–B2 exam:
- Task 1: express and justify viewpoints **clearly**
- Task 2: **argue** clearly and fairly objectively

Some minor lack of clarity in argumentation is allowed, but the main logic must be easy to follow.

**Difference from B1**  
B1: viewpoints are expressed, but reasons may be unclear or simple  
B2: viewpoints are **clearly justified and argued**

## 2. Text structure and coherence (Tekstoppbygging)

> **逻辑，连贯，段落展开**  
>
> 文章开头要有 引入 (introduction)，结尾要有 总结 (conclusion)。
>
> Introduction 要点题，说明文章要讨论的内容 (what will be discussed)。
> 
> 段落之间要有 过渡 (transition)，内容要有 发展 (development)。
> 一个段落围绕一个主题 (theme) 展开，段落内句子要紧密相关 (cohesion)。段落以中心句 (topic sentence) 开头，然后展开 (elaboration)，最后总结 (conclusion)。
>
> Conclusion 要总结文章内容，重申观点 (restate main points)。

At **B2**, your texts should:

- Be **easy to follow overall**
- Have **clear structure and progression**
- Use **a wide range of linking devices** appropriately
- Show logical paragraphing and thematic coherence

Typical B2 features:
- varied connectors (for example: *derfor, imidlertid, dessuten, på den ene siden*)
- clear introduction and development of ideas

Some local lack of clarity is allowed, especially in argumentation, but the text must mostly flow well.

**Difference from B1**  
B1: coherence is mostly OK  
B2: coherence is **clear, structured, and controlled**

## 3. Vocabulary (Ordforråd)

At **B2**, you:

- Control a **broad vocabulary**
- Can **vary formulations**
- Choose words that **fit the context**
- Can write about **abstract or unfamiliar topics**

Errors:
- May occur
- **Do not lead to misunderstandings**

**Difference from B1**  
B1: vocabulary is adequate but limited  
B2: vocabulary is **flexible, varied, and precise**

---

## 4. Grammar and sentence structure (Grammatikk)

At **B2**, you:

- Have a **good grasp of basic grammar**
- Use **varied sentence structures**
- Use **complex sentences** mostly successfully
- Make errors, but:
  - they are not elementary
  - they **do not disturb understanding**

Typical B2 errors:
- occasional inversion mistakes
- issues in complex subordinate clauses

These are tolerated as long as the text remains clear.

**Difference from B1**  
B1: errors can cause misunderstandings  
B2: errors are **minor and non-disruptive**

---

## 5. Spelling and punctuation (Rettskriving og tegnsetting)

At **B2**, you:

- Have **good control** of spelling and punctuation
- May still make mistakes (often commas)
- Show consistency and clarity

Texts should look clearly more controlled than B1.

---

## Overall B2 profile

A B2-level text is:

- Clear and mostly easy to read
- Well structured
- Linguistically varied
- Grammatically controlled
- Independent and confident in tone

**Key requirement**  
To be placed at B2, the candidate must meet **B2 level in all criteria**, not just some of them.

---

### One-sentence summary

B2 writing shows **clear argumentation, good structure, varied language, and solid grammatical control**, with errors that do not interfere with understanding.
