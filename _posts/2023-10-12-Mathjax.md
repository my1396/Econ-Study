Mathjax enables LaTex syntax to write math equations and show on Github Pages. 

Current (2023) version is V3.

The configuration, loading, and startup processes for MathJax version 3 are different from those of version 2 in a number of ways. Where version 2 had several different methods for configuring MathJax, version 3 streamlines the process and has only one, as described below. In version 2, you always loaded `MathJax.js`, and added a `config=...` parameter to provide a combined configuration file, but in version 3 you load one of several different files, depending on your needs (so you can avoid multiple file transfers, and also use MathJax synchronously, which was not possible in version 2).

## Version 3

Add the following codes to the end of the file `_layouts/base.html`. This loads `MathJax` automatically for all posts. 

```css
<!-- inline config -->
<script>
  MathJax = {
    tex: {
      inlineMath: [['$', '$'], ['\\(', '\\)']]
    },
    svg: {
    fontCache: 'global'
  	}
  };
</script>

<!-- load MathJax -->
<script type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" async
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js">
</script>
```

The first script defines a global object named `MathJax` that contains configuration data for the various components of MathJax. 

The `MathJax` has to be put before the script that loads `MathJax` itself. 

It allows

- `tex` to use single dollar signs (`$`) as  in-line math delimiters, in addition to the usual `\(...\)`.
- `svg` to use a global font cache for all expressions on the page. 
  - `svg` is a Scalable Vector Graphics; it is scalable, high quality at any resolution.
