**Make your site and pages appear on Google search result**

Set up sitemap for your website and submit it to Google Search Engine.

`sitemap` address: <https://my1396.github.io/sitemap.xml>

What is a <span style='color:#32CD32'>**Sitemap**</span> for?

>If your website doesnâ€™t have any posts or pages, you may not need a sitemap. But for a blog with several posts, a sitemap is necessary (if you want to rank better in search engines). You can submit your sitemap to major search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo etc., so that their respective bots crawl your site and index them. Only after indexing, your website link appears in the search results.

**Google Search Console** (check if your page is indexed successfully or not)

1.   create a property on Google Search Console

2.   submit the address of your sitemap file to Google Search Engine

<https://search.google.com/search-console/sitemaps?resource_id=https%3A%2F%2Fmy1396.github.io%2F>

>   For my case, I could not search my site via site name until **2 days** after I submit the sitemap file. And it is **5 days** for posts to be searchable via title name. It takes some patience.

>   It takes days to weeks for a website to be indexed.



How to generate `sitemap.xml` for Github Pages websites?

My site is hosted on github-pages. It seems github pages now supports this.

Jekyll blogs will not have sitemap by default. You can always generate them using a small snippet of code. Just had to add to `_config.yml`:

```bash
gems:
  - jekyll-sitemap
```

You will not be able to see the XML file created for sitemap inside your directory.

Now, commit the changes and hit the URL `yourwebsite.com/sitemap.xml`. You should see all your links listed there.



**Discovered but not indexed**

<https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/50379>

Why can I do to speed up indexing?

- inspect URL and **request indexing** [this takes a few days, but it works]
- build backlinks to your repository from other reputable websites.



**Google Analytics** (GA)

1. create a account and a property.

2. find your `Mesurement ID` at Admin $\rightarrow$ Data Streams $\rightarrow$ Measurement ID
