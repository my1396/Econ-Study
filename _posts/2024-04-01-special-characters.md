## Unicode Hex Input

You can key unicode hex input directly into any application in Mac OS X.

1. Andd `Unicode Hex Input` in your keyboard input sources.

   Under the Apple menu (at the left of the menu bar), choose System Preferences…, then choose Keyboard. Make sure there’s a check in the box to the left of “Show Keyboard & Character Viewers in menu bar”: This will display a flag (or flag-like) icon near the right-hand end of your menubar. Then choose Input Sources… to access the preferences for Language & Text. Near the bottom of the (long) scrolling list, place a check next to `Unicode Hex Input`, and at the bottom right, make sure there's a check next to “Show Input menu in menu bar.”

2. Choosing the Unicode Hex Input method alters the behaviour of the “Option” key. To place U+03B1 into your document, hold down the Option key and – while holding it down – tap the four keys 0, 3, b, and 1 in sequence. On pressing the last of the four, the character α appears; you can then release the option key.
