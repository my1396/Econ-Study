## OS Settings

- **Trackpad** 
  
  - Tab to Click
  
    System Preferences > Trackpad > Point & Click tab > check "Tap to click"

  - Three Finger Drag

- **Magic Mouse**
  
  Issue: Tracking speed too slow even at max setting.  
  Fix: use `defaults read -g com.apple.mouse.scaling` to check current speed; should be 3 default. You can specify to a higher value, e.g., 5, by using the following cmd:
  
  ```bash
  defaults write -g com.apple.mouse.scaling 5
  ```
  
  Then log out and log back in to take effect.

- **Scroll bar**: show when scrolling
  
  System Preferences > General > check "Show scroll bars: When scrolling"

  I like this setting because the Finder will look less cluttered. Otherwise, there will be obnoxious grey columns of scroll bars in the Finder windows.

- **Finder**
  
  - Use column view as default
    
    Open Finder > View > Show View Options > select "Always open in column view".

## Programming Tools

- [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh): tool to install software on mac

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/mac): version control
  
  ```bash
  brew install git
  ```

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): powerful editor

- Xcode Command Line Tools
  
  Some OS comes with Xcode pre-installed, check if you have it:

  ```bash
  xcode-select -p
  ```
  If you see a path like `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`, you have it installed. 

  If you don't have it, you can install it with:

  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```
- Terminal syntax highlighting for Zsh shell. 打造赏心悦目的终端界面 😎
  
  - [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/#install)
    
    Oh My Zsh terminal looks like the following, and your VS Code terminal will also inherit the same style.
    
    <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1wfUZoJOTvbHONqIPdNZXcXnq7KYuDKaQ&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />
    [GitHub - ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)

    Besides its good looks, Oh My Zsh is a framework for managing your zsh configuration, and it comes with a lot of helpful functions, helpers, plugins, themes.

    Oh My Zsh plugin directory: 
    
    - `~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/` (for built-in plugins) 自带插件目录
    - `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/` (for custom plugins) 用户自定义插件目录
  
  - [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
    
    This is a minimal plugin for Oh My Zsh that provides syntax highlighting for the zsh shell.

    Once you have installed Oh My Zsh, you can check if you have installed `zsh-syntax-highlighting` by looking into the plugin directory.

    1.  If you don't see the `zsh-syntax-highlighting` folder there, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

        <a name="install-zsh-syntax-highlighting"></a>
        ```bash
        # Cloning the GitHub repository directly into the Oh My Zsh plugin directory:
        git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git \
        ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
        ```
        
        Do <span class="env-orange">NOT</span> install it via Homebrew if you are using Oh My Zsh, because Oh My Zsh won't be able to find it automatically. <a href="#brew-plugin-not-found">↩︎</a>

        > For custom plugins, git clone into `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/`.  
        > Oh My Zsh will automatically load plugins from this directory.

    2.  Then, enable syntax highlighter in your `~/.zshrc` file:
        Find the `plugins=(...)` line and add `zsh-syntax-highlighting` at the end:

        ```bash
        plugins=( [plugins...] zsh-syntax-highlighting)
        ```

        Note that plugins are separated by spaces (do not use commas).

    3.  Finally, reload Zsh by running `source ~/.zshrc` or restarting your terminal.
    4.  Test if it works.
        
        ```bash
        echo "This is a test"
        ```
        
        If you see different colors for different parts of the command, it means syntax highlighting is working. It looks like the following on my machine:

        <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1Mt9VF64s0mbTLOM4wBX34_rsDMPwcMW2&sz=w1000" alt="zsh-syntax-highlighting" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:120%;" />

        Valid commands are in green, strings in yellow, etc.
        
        Invalid commands will be highlighted in red.


    It is possible you only install the plugin without Oh My Zsh, but then you need to configure it manually. 
    Follow instructions on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com): Window management

- [CapsLock](https://github.com/Vonng/Capslock?tab=readme-ov-file#install): Keyboard shortcut

- [AltTab](https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/): App switching
  
  It support selecting windows of the same app. Each window has its own preview thumbnail.

- [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com) <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1zHTFxvq01YmC1TkQH37l5CajTeP48PLy&sz=w100" alt="CleanShot" width="30" height="30" />: $30 one-time purchase; 30% discount for students with valid .edu email.
  
  Download the free version from [Xclient](https://xclient.info/s/cleanshot-x.html)
  
  - Record shortcuts for screen recording:
    
    - Capture Area: ⌃⌘A
    - Capture Window: ⌃⌘W
  
  - Hide **Wallpaper** when capture Window
    
    Preferences > Wallpaper > Window screenshots > Choose "Transparent"
    
    You can adjusting "Padding" to reduce the extra space around the window. I like to set it a bit smaller than the default.

    <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1P3kJ0gfJfil24ukAufB2S9is2M96Npk6&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

    You can remove all paddings by sliding to the leftmost position and **uncheck "Include window shadow"** as follows:

    <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1kGQEef6j6fseUmoZax_ZoMhXCUrVzoMM&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; width:600px;" />

    A sideeffect of this is that the screenshot will be cropped without radius and the boarders are removed as well. 
    It looks less pretty when you are used to the default macOS style.
  
  - Open Annotate tool directly after taking screenshot:
    
    Preferences > General > After capture > **check "Open Annotate tool"**
  
  - Overlay Thumbnail
    
    I like to disable this feature because it is distracting.

    <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=17sYLyI9GzVaEiAludJXvyQ59x1YtnHMt&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

    This way, after taking a screenshot, the annotation window will open directly without showing the thumbnail overlay.
    You can add annotations, save, or ⌘W to close the window if you want to discard the screenshot.
  
  [Here](https://alchemists.io/articles/clean_shot) is a nice tutorial on CleanShot main features.

   Flexible HiDPI scaling; useful for <span class="env-green">2K external monitors</span> that do not support Retina resolution.

   Turn on HiDPI mode by clicking the menu bar icon > Click "High Resolution (HiDPI)".

   💡 It helps to a certain degree; remember, it is only a *marginal improvement* over non-Retina monitors.
   To get the best display quality, invest in a *4K monitor* if you have 💰.

   In short, 有用但不大。还行吧，比没有强。🤣

## FAQ

<a name="brew-plugin-not-found"></a>
Q: I installed zsh-syntax-highlighting via Homebrew, but Oh My Zsh cannot find it. What should I do?  
A: If you installed zsh-syntax-highlighting via Homebrew, you might see an error like this when you start your terminal:

```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting

[oh-my-zsh] plugin 'zsh-syntax-highlighting' not found
```

Note that if you use Homebrew to install it, the plugin will be installed in the Homebrew directory, and Oh My Zsh won't be able to find it automatically. 

Homebrew usually installs packages in `/usr/local/opt/` (Intel Macs) or `/opt/homebrew/opt/` (Apple Silicon Macs). You can find the exact path by running:

```bash
brew --prefix zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

Oh My Zsh only looks for plugins in its own plugin directories:

```bash
~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/
~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
```

To fix this, two options:

- If you decide to install with Homebrew, you need extra configuration by addting the plugin path to your `~/.zshrc` file. [↩](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
  
  ```bash
  # Add this line to your ~/.zshrc file
  source $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
  ```

  手动管理太麻烦了。

- “Pure” Oh My Zsh approach ✅
  
  Install `zsh-syntax-highlighting` by cloning the GitHub repository directly into the Oh My Zsh plugin directory, as described <a href="#install-zsh-syntax-highlighting">above</a>.
