## OS Settings

- **Trackpad** 
  
  - Tab to Click
  
    System Preferences > Trackpad > Point & Click tab > check "Tap to click"

- **Scroll bar**: show when scrolling
  
  System Preferences > General > check "Show scroll bars: When scrolling"

  I like this setting because the Finder will look less cluttered. Otherwise, there will be obnoxious grey columns of scroll bars in the Finder windows.

- **Finder**
  
  - Use column view as default
    
    Open Finder > View > Show View Options > select "Always open in column view".

## Programming

- [Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh): tool to install software on mac
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/mac): version control
  ```bash
  brew install git
  ```
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): powerful editor
- Xcode Command Line Tools
  
  Some OS comes with Xcode pre-installed, check if you have it:

  ```bash
  xcode-select -p
  ```
  If you see a path like `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`, you have it installed. 

  If you don't have it, you can install it with:

  ```bash
  xcode-select --install
  ```

  Follow instruction <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2024/08/11/Latex-Install.html">HERE</a> to install LaTeX.

- [MS Office](https://norduniversitet.sharepoint.com/sites/O365)
  
  Just install the Microsoft 365 Office suite. It includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and more. So you don't need to install them separately.
