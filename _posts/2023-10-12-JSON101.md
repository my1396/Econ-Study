JSON stands for **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation, it is a **text format** for storing and transporting data. Originally developed for JavaScript.

JSON is useful for creating a configuration file for Applications, and for Internet to send data.

Syntax:

- Data is in name/value pairs

  A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon `:`, followed by a value:

  ```js
  "name":"John"
  ```

  - JSON **names** are string, and must be quoted using **double quotes** `"name"`.

  - JSON values can be a string, number, object, array, boolean, or null. If the value is a string, then it must be double quoted. If it is of other types, you can leave the double quotes.

    ```js
    {
        "name":"John", 
        "age":31, 
        "city":"New York",
    	  "Male":true,
        "address":{
            "street_address":"21 2nd Street",
            "city":"New York",
            "state":"NY",
            "postal_code":"10021-3100"
        }
    }
    ```

  - Whitespace, such as spaces, tabs, and line breaks outside a double-quoted string literal are ignored in the syntax. This means you can format your JSON in a way that is most readable for your use case.

    `{"a":12}` equivalent to `{"a":1 2}`

    **Readability**: While whitespace does not affect functionality, using spaces and line breaks can greatly improve the readability of your JSON. 

    Whether adding a space after `:` is a pesonal choice of taste.

    For instance, the above JSON can be formatted as follows.

    ```js
    { 
         "name": "John", 
         "age": 30, 
         "city": "New York" 
     } 
    ```

    

- Data is separated by commas `,`

- Curly braces hold objects

- Square brackets hold arrays
