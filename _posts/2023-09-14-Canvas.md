### Canvas Quizzes

<https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/tkb-p/Instructor#Quizzes>

Multi-part questions

<https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Question-Forum/Multi-part-question-with-numerical-answers/m-p/61887>

To create this I used a text (no question) type for the initial information and then fill in the blank questions for the actual questions. Here's the link to information on quizzes (and quiz questions) that should help - [Quizzes](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-4131#jive_content_id_Quizzes)

Some nice options to tick

1. Don't forget to **shuffle answers**. Otherwise, the correct answer always show as the first choice.

2. Show all questions at one.

### Table on Canvas

Two options:

1. edit in Excle, use html table generator, paste html code to canvas, and format as you like [time consuming, but best visual effect, clear and neat]

   table $\rightarrow$ code: <https://wordhtml.com> 

   table $\leftrightarrow$ code: <https://divtable.com/generator/>

2. edit in Excle, paste as picture, then save and add the table as picture. [quick but rather blurry] 





### Edit math equations on Canvas

1. Use `$$` and `$$` to enclose your equations, then 
2. select and hit the $\sqrt{x}$ symbol. 
3. The eqn editor will automatically convert the eqn for you.



Tip:

- Select ‘Directly Edit LaTeX’ in the Maths Editor to create complex equations. A **preview** of what will be displayed is shown underneath the LaTeX code.



A nice Tutorial how to edit latex on Canvas

<https://ready.msudenver.edu/self-help-tutorials/accessibility/use-mathjax-and-latex-to-display-equations-in-canvas/>

1. Type  the appropriate Delimiter to signal that the equation should be rendered in LaTeX.

   - **`\(`** and **`\)`** should be used for equations that are meant to be displayed **inline** with text.

     When edit quiz questions, use `\(...\)` as delimiters in LaTex. This saves time when you copy and paste from LaTex to Canvas.

   - **`$$`** should be used for equations that are meant to be displayed in separate **blocks**.

2. Type  the Equation between the delimiters.

   - Ex: `\(2+2=4\)` for inline text or `$$2+2=4$$` for block text

3. *Click* **Save** for whatever text field you are working in. 

   The text field won't render the eqn. for you. Only **after** you exit the text field and preview the question, the eqn will show up properly.

4. *Check* that the **Equation** is being displayed correctly.



Can also insert a file into the field box.

### Add images

Use the following codes. Need to number the figures manually.

```html
<figure><img style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom: 20%;" src="/courses/29234/files/1639589/preview" alt="Boxplot for the two groups." />
    <figcaption>Fig. 1 Boxplot for the two groups.<br /><br /></figcaption>
</figure>
```





**Assignment**

Setting up different due dates for one assignment

1. Select Assignment

   <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1OzpbMOP7Ra3JNTI7af3590NuOzZ4SK8e&sz=w1000" alt="Assignment" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

2. Add due date.

   <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1HjHBFnKgFci5qOmeS6MjKRdpNvQ0nmc0&sz=w1000" alt="Assignment" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

3. Choose file type to limit to pdf submissions. Easier for grading.
