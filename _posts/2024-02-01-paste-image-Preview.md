It is possible to paste an image into a PDF page from the clipboard, but you must first convert the image to an “object image” first.

**Steps**

1. Open the source image file and target PDF using Preview
2. Press the following key sequences:

   - ⌘+A (select the entire image)
   - ⌘+C (copy it to the clipboard)
   - ⌘+V (paste the image on top of the original as an “object image”)
   Click on the object image you just pasted on top of the original image
3. Press ⌘+C to copy the new object image to the clipboard
4. Click on to target page and press ⌘+V to paste the image into it.
