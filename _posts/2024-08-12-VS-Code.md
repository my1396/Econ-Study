[VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is an <span class="env-green">open source AI code editor</span> developed by Microsoft. Being open source, everyone can be a developer to the app. Hence comes what I like about it: VS code has extensive extension support, making it suitable for a wide range of programming languages and development tasks. It is highly customizable.
The AI integration is done through <a href="#github-copilot">GitHub Copilot</a>, which is powerful and provides seamless AI assistance while coding/writing.


**Useful resources:**

## Layout

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1Ibf8FiPU7Ghc_ckzu1btT44VlRFnVJ4d&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

- **Activity Bar** is the vertical bar on the far left side of the window. It contains extensions that can contribute to [View Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/ux-guidelines/views#view-containers).
  
  - Drag and drop icons to reorder them.
  - Right-click on an icon to hide it from the Activity Bar.

- **Secondary Side Bar** is located to the left of the editor region. It can be useful to see two views open at the same time. It is often used by the Copilot Chat.
  
- **Editor Groups**
  
  By default, each opened editor goes into the same editor group and open new file as a tab to the right. 
  
  You can create new editor groups in order to group similar or related files, or to allow side by side editing of the same file. 
  
  Create a new editor group by dragging an editor to the side, or using one of the Split commands in the context menu to duplicate the current editor into a new editor group to the left, right, above, or below.

- **Output Panel** (<kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> to toggle the panel if it is not loaded automatically) - An additional space for views below the editor region. [↩︎](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/ux-guidelines/panel) 
  
  By default, it contains output, debug information, errors and warnings, and an integrated terminal. 
  
  You can right click the Panel menu bar to move it to the left or right for more vertical space.

  - Refer to the webpage to learn how to reorganize the default layout.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How to change Panel position?  
A: Right-click on the Panel title bar > Panel Position > choose from Left | Right | Bottom | Top, default is Bottom. Or choose "**View: Toggle Panel Position**" from the Command Palette.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Explorer View**

The [Explorer view](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_explorer-view) is used to browse, open, and manage the files and folders in your project. 

- Type <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (Quick Open) to quickly search and open a file by its name.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Keyboard shortcuts

Command Palette > "**Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts**" to open the Keyboard Shortcuts editor.

Click <i class="codicon codicon-go-to-file" aria-hidden="true" style="font-size:1.5em; vertical-align: middle;"></i> to open the `keybindings.json` file to customize your own shortcuts.

| Shortcut              | Function                                             |

| `opt` + `cmd` + `B`   | Close GitHub Copilot chat in the [Secondary Side Bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/custom-layout#_secondary-side-bar) |



**Useful Extensions:**

- Markdown: `Markdown Preview Enhanced`, `Markdown+Math`, `Markdown All in One`
- TeX: `LaTeX-Workshop` (this installs `intellisense` automatically)
- Spell check, autocomplete: `Code Spell Checker`, `intellisense`



**Extension Reload**

Sometimes you need to reload an extension to apply changes.

Command Palette → “**Developer: Reload Window**”

- This is equivalent to restarting VS Code, but it only reloads the current window and does not close the entire application.
- A quick reload ensures that your environment is up-to-date and functioning as intended, preventing potential disruptions in your workflow. 
  - Generally, changes in settings apply immediately, but some settings require a reload to take effect.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


<span class="env-green">**Find and Replace in Selection**</span>

1. <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> to open Find/Replace
2. Select your line of text
3. Click the "Find in Selection" icon to the right (or using keyboard shortcut <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>)
4. Enter your find and replace characters in their inputs
5. Click the "Replace All" icon

Close Find/Replace with <kbd>esc</kbd>.

**Search Across Files**


Press <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> and enter your search term. VS Code will search over all files in the currently opened folder. 

Command Palette approach: enter the **Search: Quick Search** command.

Search results are grouped into files containing the search term, with an indication of the hits in each file and its location. Expand a file to see a preview of all of the hits within that file. Then single-click on one of the hits to view it in the editor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Language Identifiers**

In Visual Studio Code, each [language mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview#_changing-the-language-for-the-selected-file) has a unique specific language identifier. That identifier is rarely seen by the user except in the settings, for example, when associating file extensions to a language:

```json
"files.associations": {
    "*.myphp": "php"
}
```

Note that <span class="env-green">casing matters</span> for <span class="env-green">exact identifier</span> matching ('Markdown' != 'markdown')

Every language defines its *id* through the `languages` configuration point in the extension's `package.json` file:

```json
"languages": [{
    "id": "java",
    "extensions": [ ".java", ".jav" ],
    "aliases": [ "Java", "java" ]
}]
```

You can find a list of known identifiers in the [language identifier reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers#_known-language-identifiers).

| Language   | Identifier |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| LaTeX      | `latex`    |
| Markdown   | `markdown` |
| R          | `r`        |
| R Markdown | `rmd`      |
| Quarto     | `quarto`   |

- Note that all identifiers are in lower cases.

## Version Control

Visual Studio Code has integrated source control management (SCM) and includes [Git](https://git-scm.com/) support out-of-the-box.

Use the Source Control icon <i class="codicon codicon-git-branch" aria-hidden="true" style="font-size:1.5em; vertical-align: middle;"></i> in the activity bar to access the Source Control view.

Error: No source control providers registered.  
Cause: Git built-in extension was disabled.  
Fix: Go to Extensions, type: `@builtin git`, then **Enable** Git from the Git extension settings.

The Source Control view shows the details of your current repository changes: CHANGES, STAGED CHANGES and MERGE CHANGES.

When you select a file in the Source Control view, you will see the changes that you have made to that file in a diff editor.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=17hy2XUkkIHQ6BytDXQ1raHOYVmq7mcEE&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />


File version control status

- **U** - Untracked file
- **A** - Added file
- **M** - Modified file





___

**Code Actions**

Code Actions can provide both refactorings and **Quick Fixes** for detected issues (highlighted with <span style='color:#EE0000FF'>red squiggles</span>). When the cursor is on a squiggle or on a selected text region, VS Code shows a light bulb icon 💡 in the editor to indicate that a Code Action is available. If you select the Code Action light bulb or use the **Quick Fix** command ⌘., the Quick Fixes and refactorings control is presented.

> If you have enabled GitHub Copilot, you can choose to fix with Copilot. This is a very convenient way to debug your code.

Q: What is *refactoring*?  
A: Visual Studio Code supports refactoring operations (*refactorings*) such as [Extract Method](https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html) and [Extract Variable](https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractVariable.html) to improve your codebase from within the editor. For example, a common refactoring used to avoid duplicating code (a maintenance headache) is the [Extract Method](https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html) refactoring, where you select source code and pull it out into its own shared method, so that can reuse the code elsewhere.

## Code Snippets

Snippets files are written in JSON, support C-style comments (`//`), and can define an *unlimited number* of snippets. Snippets support most TextMate syntax for dynamic behavior, intelligently format whitespace based on the insertion context, and allow easy multiline editing.

- a **language** snippet file

  Single-language user-defined snippets are defined in a specific language's snippet file (for example `javascript.json`), which you can access by language identifier through **Snippets: Configure Snippets**. 

  A snippet is only accessible when editing the language for which it is defined.

- a **global** snippet file

  Multi-language and global user-defined snippets are all defined in "global" snippet files (JSON with the file suffix `.code-snippets`), which is also accessible through **Snippets: Configure Snippets**. 

  File path: <span class="env-green">`$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets`</span>

Create your own snippets: `Code` > `Settings` > `Configure Snippets`

**Syntax**

```json
// in file 'Code/User/snippets/javascript.json'
{
  "For Loop": {
    "prefix": ["for", "for-const"],
    "body": ["for (const ${2:element} of ${1:array}) {", "\t$0", "}"],
    "description": "A for loop."
  }
}
```

- "For Loop" is the snippet name. 

  `prefix` defines <span class="env-green">**one or more** trigger words</span> that display the snippet in IntelliSense. Substring matching is performed on prefixes, so in this case, "fc" could match "for-const".

  `body` is one or more lines of content, which will be joined as multiple lines upon insertion. Newlines and embedded tabs will be formatted according to the context in which the snippet is inserted.

  `description` is an *optional* description of the snippet displayed by IntelliSense.

  `scope` optional property that takes one or more [language identifiers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers), which makes the snippet available only for those specified languages. If no `scope` property is given, then the global snippet is available in **all** languages.

**Rules for Body:**

- Enclosed in an array of strings. Each entry in the array represents one line of the inserted snippet.

- Use `$1`, `$2` to specify cursor locations. The number is the order in which tabstops will be visited, whereas `$0` denotes the <span class="env-green">final cursor position</span>. 

  The `body` of the example above has three placeholders (listed in order of traversal): `${1:array}`, `${2:element}`, and `$0`. You can quickly jump to the next placeholder with <kbd>Tab</kbd>.

  `$0` is an optional special case that always comes last.

- **Placeholders** are tabstops with values, like `${1:foo}`. The placeholder text will be inserted and selected such that it can be easily changed. Placeholders can be nested, like `${1:another ${2:placeholder}}`.

  The string after the colon `:` (if any) is the default text. 

- **Variables**: With `$name` or `${name:default}`, you can insert the value of a variable. 

  - <span class="env-green">`TM_SELECTED_TEXT`</span> The currently selected text or the empty string.

- Escape specail characters.
  
  With `\` (backslash), you can escape `$`, `}`, `\`, and `"`. 
- Multilined `body`: simply wrap each line with double quotes.

Q: When using `$TM_SELECTED_TEXT`, if you type the prefix, the selected text will be overwritten. What to do with it?  
A: VS code remembers the text. When you finish typing the prefix, the formatted text will show up accordingly.

```json
// customer defined snippets
{
  "Colored Span Green": {
      "prefix": "cs-green",
      "body": [
        "<span style=\"color: #008B45;\">$TM_SELECTED_TEXT</span>$0"
      ],
      "description": "Insert a green colored span"
  },
  "Math Helper Parentheses": {
      "scope": "markdown, latex",
      "prefix": "\\(",
      "body": [
        "\\left($1\\right)$0"
      ],
      "description": "Insert parentheses with LaTeX math formatting"
  },
  "Math Helper Brackets": {
      "scope": "markdown, latex",
      "prefix": "\\[",
      "body": [
        "\\left[$1\\right]$0"
      ],
      "description": "Insert brackets with LaTeX math formatting"
  },
  "Separator":{
      "scope": "markdown, latex, quarto",
      "prefix": ["---", "dash"],
      "body": [
        "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
        "$0"
      ],
      "description": "Insert a horizontal separator line"
  },
  "Insert codicon": {
      "scope": "markdown, quarto",
      "prefix": "codicon",
      "body": [
        "<i class=\"codicon codicon-$1\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\"></i>$0"
      ],
      "description": "Insert a VS Code codicon"
  },
  "Set working directory in R": {
      "scope": "r",
      "prefix": ["swd", "set-work-dir"],
      "body": [
        "setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()\\$path))$0"
      ],
      "description": "Set working directory in R"
  },
}
```

- `"scope": "markdown, latex"` set `scope` to  `"markdown, latex"` such that `\(` works inside dollar signs.

- To [escape double backslashes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/33933#issuecomment-328793257), you have to use `\\\\\\\\` (8 backslashes).
  - In TextMate you *can* but must not escape a backslash with a backslash, so to insert 1 backslash have either `\` or `\\`
  - In JSON you *must* escape a backslash with another backslash, so to insert 1 backslash have either `\\` or `\\\\`, to insert 2 `\\\\\\\\`

- Other characters that need to escape in snippet body:
  - double quotes `\"`
  - dollar sign `\\$`

Q: Is it possible to set max lines of a table printed in notebook?  
A: The simple answer is NO. Seetings → Features → Notebook only limits the cell size of a pure text based output. It does NOT apply to outputs such as matrices, dataframes or other spreadsheet-like outputs (e.g. from the `View()` function in R.)


___

## Configuration

[Change settings of VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings)

- **Menu bar**: Code → Settings (keyboard shortcut: <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>)
  
  A useful feature is to copy the json for the settings of interest in the UI. 

  <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=10iN98_ZJ4sUFzOngKsFMCxZxGldixVOA&sz=w1000" alt="copy as json" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

  When you hover over the **title** of the setting, a gear icon <i class="codicon codicon-settings-gear dynamic-setting-icon" aria-hidden="true" style="font-size:1.5em; vertical-align: middle;"></i> will appear, choose "Copy Setting as JSON" to copy the setting in json format.

- **Configuration file**: change directly in the user settings file (`settings.json`)

**Setting file locations**: 

- **macOS User Settings:** <span class="env-green">Global settings</span> that apply to **all VS Code workspaces and projects**

  Located in the user's home directory in the VS Code application data folder: `$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json`

  Examples: Theme, font size, editor preferences, extensions settings, etc.

  Lower priority (can be overridden by workspace settings)

- **Workspace Settings:** <span class="env-green">Project-specific settings</span> that apply only to the current workspace/project.

  Located in `.vscode/settings.json` inside the project folder.

  Examples: Project-specific linting rules, build configurations, language settings for this project

  **Priority**: Higher priority (overrides user settings)

  > ❗VS Code use the <span class="env-green">root</span> project folder to determine the workspace settings. 
  > 
  > If you have a nested project structure, i.e., a `.vscode/settings.json` files in a subfolder, VS Code will <span class="env-orange">NOT</span> recognize it unless you open that subfolder as the root folder in VS Code.


You can toggle between User and Workspace Settings by choosing the tab in the UI or if you are using the json file, you can determine which settings you are working on by looking at the file path.


Run `Open Config Script` to open `config.js` (a JavaScript configuration file):

- define TeX macros `KatexConfig`, `mathjaxConfig` ...



Q: What is the [difference between `.json` and `.js`](https://www.koombea.com/blog/json-vs-javascript/)?  
A: `.json` is a subset of `.js`, which stands for JavaScript. 

- If you store only data, use `.json`; 

  You can think of `.json` as a YAML frontmatter in markdown.

- if you have some sort of logic (functions, conditions, loops ...), use `.js`.


Q: How to sync settings across devices?  
A: Turn on Setttings Sync.

<img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/configure/settings-sync/turn-on-sync.png" alt="
" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

To use Sync settings, you need to sign in (GitHub or Microsoft account) and select which settings you want to sync. Currently, the Settings Sync supports the following settings:

-   Settings
-   Keyboard shortcuts
-   User snippets
-   User tasks
-   UI State
-   Extensions
-   Profiles

Q: How to view historical settings data?  
A: Type `Settings Sync: Show Synced Data` in the Command Palette. [↩︎](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings-sync#_restoring-data)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Share configurations

You can share your **settings, keybindings, extensions, snippets, and UI state** with others by exporting a profile.

Q: What is a profile?  
A: A profile is a collection of settings, extensions, and configurations that define your VS Code environment. Profiles allow you to switch between different setups easily, depending on your workflow or project requirements.

VS Code treats your current configuration as the **Default Profile**. As you modify settings, install extensions, or change UI layout by moving views, these customizations are tracked in the Default Profile.

Q: Why use profiles?  
A: You can share your VS Code configuration with others or across different machines. A common user case is that you can share with students to quickly set up their VS Code environment. For example, educators can create a profile with a specific set of extensions and settings needed for a computer science class and then share that profile with students. [↩](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/profiles#_uses-for-profiles) 


Q: How to create a profile?  
A: To create a profile, follow these steps:

1. Click the gear icon <i class="codicon codicon-settings-gear dynamic-setting-icon" aria-hidden="true" style="font-size:1.5em; vertical-align: middle;"></i> in the lower-left corner of the VS Code window to open the Settings menu.
2. Click on **Profiles**, this will open the Profiles editor.
   
   <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=146aVJx6nVDXTZ7d6GuKcwDBGDlgrMOrO&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />
3. Click on the **New Profile** button. 
   
   This opens the New Profile form, where you can enter a profile name, choose an icon, and configure the contents that are included in the new profile.

#### Export

You can export a profile for saving it or sharing it with others by using the **Export...** button in the overflow actions of the profile you want to export.

<img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/configure/profiles/profiles-editor-export-profile.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

When you select **Export...**, you are prompted for the profile name and whether you want to export to either a [GitHub gist](https://docs.github.com/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) or to your local file system.

#### Import

You can import an existing profile from the **Profiles editor** by selecting the **Import Profile...**button in the dropdown actions of the **New Profile** button.

<img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/configure/profiles/profiles-editor-import-profile.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

When you select Import Profile..., you are prompted for the URL of a GitHub gist or the file location of a profile via an Import Profile dialog. Once you have selected the profile, the Profile creation form opens with the profile to import pre-selected. You can continue to modify the profile and select Create to import the profile.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How to customize language-specific setttings?  
A: Open User Settings → Type `@lang:markdown` into the search widget. This will show configurable settings for that specific language. Alternatively, you can change directly in the settings JSON file.

```json
"[markdown]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "editor.renderWhitespace": "all",
    "editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": "off"
  }
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: How to **preview a markdown file**?  
A: Two options:

- Open Preview (⇧⌘V)
- Open Preview to the Side (⌘K V)

Use either the keyboard shortcuts or click the Preview button. 

- Double clicking an element in the Markdown preview will automatically open the editor for the file and scroll to the line nearest the clicked element.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=14rY5JBq2TNjT7Z4Nc5x5_jMa0esNGlN5&sz=w1000" alt="VS code: preview markdown" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />


To set **html preview** using external browser, you need to change setting for the two extensions:

- Quarto Preview: personally I prefer to use the build-in preview as it basically provides a live preview just like *Markdown Preview Enhanced*.
- Live Preview: set to external browser, as Live Preview is more often used to preview the whole website.

Q: How to <span class="env-green">open the User settings json file</span> `settings.json`?  
A: Follow the following steps:

1. Open the Command Palette (either with F1 or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>)
2. Type *"open settings"*
3. You are presented with a few options, choose **Open User Settings (JSON)**

You can change setting using the UI or there is a `settings.json` file which saves all configurations.

VS Code includes a button, <i class="codicon codicon-go-to-file" aria-hidden="true" style="font-size:1.5em; vertical-align: middle;"></i>, in the Settings UI gutter which can be used to switch between JSON and graphical view. See the image below:

A faster way is to use the command:

- User preferences: Command Palette → "**Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**"
- Workspace preferences: Command Palette → "**Preferences: Open Workspace Settings (JSON)**"
- Keyboard shortcuts: Command Palette → "**Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)**"

Q: How to show my installed extensions?  
A: By default, the Extensions view will show the extensions you currently have installed, and all extensions that are recommended for you. You can use the **Extensions: Focus on Installed View** command, to show the installed ones.



Q: Disable <kbd>Enter</kbd> to accept suggestions as this confuses inserting a new line.  
A: Set **Editor: Accept Suggestion On Enter** to `off`.

## Markdown

**Markdown Preview Settings**: <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview>


Q: How to get a preview of Rmarkdown?  
A: Open `settings.json`, add the following code inside the braces.

```json
/* this adds additional file extensions to markdown */
"files.associations": {
    "*.Rmd": "markdown",
    "*.qmd": "markdown",
},
```

A drawback of this setting is that you cannot run codes inside the markdown files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: How to get autocomplete, syntax highlighting in Markdown?  
A: Install `Latex Workshop` by James Yu → Switch Language Mode from `Markdown` to `markdown_latex_combined`.

This will disable markdown preview! Therefore, not recommended. ❌

Use `Markdown All in One` extension instead. ✅


### Markdown All in One

[Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) provides many useful shortcuts for editing markdown files.

| Shortcut              | Function                                 |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `cmd` + `B`           | Toggle bold                              |
| `cmd` + `I`           | Toggle italic                            |
| Select text and `cmd` + `V` | Insert link to selected text       |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How to change the language for the selected file?  
A: In the status bar, click the language indicator. This will bring up the **Select Language Mode** dropdown where you can select another language for the current file.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1d1R_ErtbQeWARja7SbsTsusiP_5Z5hS1&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:120%;" />



Q: How to change [Markdown preview security](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview-security)?  
A: You can change what content is allowed in the Markdown preview by clicking on the popup or running the `Markdown: Change preview security settings` command in any Markdown file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Visual Mode and Source Mode**

Visual Mode has inline preview of eqns, and in time preview of your markdown, like in Typora.

Side-to-side preview can be slow and the previewer can crash for a large file. That's where Visual Mode comes in handy.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1j_Btjvfn-PXR6lnNvIafGh4EOo1mK_xW&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />


I prefer Source Mode as I get full control of the markdown file.

## Markdown Preview Enhanced

Q: How to define MathJax macros?  
A: You can configure MathJax by running command `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open MathJax Config`.



Q: How to set Math Rendering Engine?  
A: Run command `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Math Rendering Option`.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1rH7Yf7_8nzpEoHKeqnKBfRPSRzj4JE41&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

Q: How to enable automatic numbering for MathJax?  
A: Run `Open Config Script` (will open `config.js`, a JavaScript configuration file), and add 

```js
mathjaxConfig: {
  tex: {
    tags: 'ams',
    "macros": {
        bold: ["{\\boldsymbol #1}", 1], // use \bold as a shorthand
        indep: "{\\perp \\!\\!\\! \\perp}",
        // bold face capital letter
        bA: "\\boldsymbol{A}",
    }
  }
};
```

to tell the TeX input processor to use the AMS **numbering** rules (where only certain environments produce numbered equations, as they would be in LaTeX, e.g., `\begin{equation}`).

You can use `\notag` or `\nonumber` to prevent individual equations from being numbered, and `\tag{}` can be used to override the usual equation number with your own symbol instead (or to add an equation tag even when automatic **numbering** is off).

You can also define your TeX macros in `config.js`.

File path: `/Users/menghan/.local/state/crossnote/config.js`



Q: How to use dark theme for Markdown Preview Enhanced (MPE)?  
A:  Run command `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Preview Theme`, choose `github-dark.css`.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1cyw-XBsexYGX08gR79k0WqjvRC9gH1f4&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />



Q: How to get separate preview for individual files?  
A: MPE has one preview tab for all files by default. You can change this by going to preferences > Markdown Preview Enhanced > Preview Mode > Set to Multiple Previews. Restart VS Code to activate the setting.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1eCCWZT7c8UZA3o_WpTRGP8xsfN6tfvrX&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

### Customize CSS

Q: How to add a custom CSS to MPE?  
A: To customize CSS for your markdown file, press `cmd-shift-p` and then run the <span class="env-green">`Markdown Preview Enhanced: Customize CSS (Global)`</span> or <span class="env-green">`Markdown Preview Enhanced: Customize CSS (Workspace)`</span> command.

The `~/.local/state/crossnote/style.less` file will open, and you can override existing style like this:

```scss
.markdown-preview.markdown-preview {
  // please write your custom style here
  // eg:
  //  color: blue;          // change font color
  //  font-size: 14px;      // change font size
  
  // custom pdf output style
  @media print {
  }

  // custom prince pdf export style
  &.prince {
  }

  // custom presentation style
  .reveal .slides {
    // modify all slides
  }

  .slides > section:nth-child(1) {
    // this will modify `the first slide`
  }
}

.md-sidebar-toc.md-sidebar-toc {
  // sidebar TOC style
}
```

For custom defined CSS classes, you can add them here so that they can be applied in both preview and exported PDF.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Issue: When I export PDF using Prince, my Chinese punctuations are corrupted. They float on the top right corner of the line.

Fix: Use a font that supports both English and Chinese characters. For example, `font-family: 'Noto Sans CJK SC'`. See below for details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="markdown-mpe-prince-cjk-font"></a>
For my `style.less`, I have

- Import KaTeX CSS for math rendering in Prince PDF export.

  Prince does not support MathJax (javascript). Therefore, we need to use KaTeX CSS for math rendering in Prince PDF export.

- Define custom classes
  
  The colors are defined to have best effects in dark mode.

- Use `&.prince { ... }` section for Prince PDF export using MPE's internal export menu.
  
  - set `font-family` to support Chinese characters and punctuations.
    
    You have to use a font that supports both English and Chinese characters. Otherwise, Chinese punctuations will be corrupted (floating on the top right corner of the line) in the exported PDF.
  
  - set a darker color for the custom classes for better printing, i.e., white background.
    
    Using the default green (set for dark mode) would be too light to read on paper.

```scss
/* Please visit the URL below for more information: */
/*   https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/customize-css */

/* Import KaTeX CSS for math rendering in Prince PDF */
@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.9/dist/katex.min.css');

.markdown-preview.markdown-preview {
  // modify your style here
  // eg: background-color: blue;

  // custom defined classes
  .env-green,
  .env-green>code,
  .env-green code {
    color: #C3E88D !important;
  }

  .env-orange,
  .env-orange>code,
  .env-orange code {
    color: #FF9900 !important;
  }
  
  /* Custom prince pdf export style */
  &.prince {
    // don't put font-family in any element, just define it explicitly here
    // 不要灵机一动改代码 😂
    font-family:
      // CJK fonts
      'PingFang SC',            // 标点都是对的
      // 以下字体 ok, 但是英文单引号好宽
      'Noto Sans CJK SC',       // 比较好看
      'WenQuanYi Micro Hei',    // 字体很窄
      'Microsoft YaHei',        // 微软雅黑
      sans-serif !important;
    
    .env-green,
    .env-green>code,
    .env-green code {
      // a darker green for Prince PDF
      color: #008B45 !important;
    }

    // Hide print-note class
    .print-note {
      display: none;
    }
    
    // hide top-link arrow 
    .top-link.hide {
      display: none;
    }
  }
}
```

经试验，`PingFang SC` (苹果默认字体) 效果最好。可以永远相信苹果的审美。微软审美是垃圾，谷歌 just so so, 可以用。

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update (2026-02): **Fix curly quotes being too wide issue.**

This can be fixed by specifying a font that supports western curly quotes, such as `Helvetica`.

Here is the fix:

```scss
/* In style.less */
/* Fix wide curly quotes - use Western font for quote characters */
@font-face {
  font-family: "Quote Fix";
  src: local("Helvetica"), local("Arial"), local("sans-serif");
  unicode-range: U+2018-2019, U+201C-201D; /* ' ' " " */
}

.markdown-preview.markdown-preview {
  &.prince {
    // set font family to support Chinese and English characters
    body, p, div, span, li, td, th, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
      font-family: 
      "Quote Fix",   // Apply fonts with Quote Fix for proper curly quote spacing
      'Noto Sans CJK SC',
      'PingFang SC',
      'WenQuanYi Micro Hei',
      'Microsoft YaHei',
      sans-serif !important;
    }
  }
}
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Math Macro Configuration

There is a global `~/.local/state/crossnote/config.js` script that could be used to configure the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension. 

`config.js` is mainly used to configure math rendering engines such as KaTeX and MathJax. You can define custom LaTeX macros and commands, set rendering options, and more.
It is in contrast to the `style.less` file, which is mainly used to customize the appearance (CSS) of the markdown preview and exported documents.

Open command palette (⇧⌘P), then run `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open Config Script (Global)` command to open it.

- You can add your custom macros.
- You can add more configurations to this script. A list of available configurations can be found [here](https://github.com/shd101wyy/crossnote#notebook-configuration).


Below is an example of the `config.js` script:

```js
({
  katexConfig: {
    macros: {},
  },

  mathjaxConfig: {
    tex: {},
    options: {},
    loader: {},
  },

  mermaidConfig: {
    startOnLoad: false,
  },
});
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Export as PDF

**For** <span class="env-green">**E-reader**</span>

With MPE's internal export feature, you can export your markdown file as PDF.

1.  Need to install *Prince XML* first.

    ```bash
    brew install --cask prince
    ```
2.  Open preview of your markdown file, hover over the bottom right corner, click the menu button.

    Alternatively, right-click anywhere in the preview window to open the context menu.

3.  Export > PDF (Prince)

This approach is fast. With TOC. 中文标点很奇怪。需要配置MPE prince output, 用支持中英文的字体，比如 'Noto Sans CJK SC'。见[上文](#markdown-mpe-prince-cjk-font)。


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Direct Export Using `prince`

**Workflow:**

1. Use MPE's menu to generate an HTML file, e.g., `input.html`. 
   
   Right-click in the preview window → Export → HTML (offline)

2. Use `prince` command in terminal to export PDF using your custom CSS. See below.

You can create a separate CSS file, e.g., `assets/css/prince.css`, and use it when exporting PDF using the `prince` command in terminal.

This approach does NOT reply on MPE's internal PDF export menu, therefore you have full control of the output and can re-use it for other projects.

In terminal, navigate to the folder containing your markdown file, then run

```bash
prince input.html -o output.pdf \
  --style https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.16.9/dist/katex.min.css \
  --style ./assets/css/prince.css
```

It will look for `input.html` in the current folder, and generate `output.pdf` using the KaTex css (for math display) and your custom `prince.css` using a **relative path**. 


The LONG command above can be wrapped into a shell script for easy re-use. For example, you can create a shell script, e.g., `export-prince.sh`, then in terminal, run

```bash 
./export-prince.sh path/to/input.html
```

It will generate `input.pdf` in the same folder as the html file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**For** <span class="env-green">**printing**</span>

For best paper quality, you can use <img src="https://yzane.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/yzane/markdown-pdf/1.5.0/1694185209938/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Services.Icons.Default" alt="" width="30" height="30" /> Markdown PDF (by yzane) extension to export PDF. 

Open the `.md` file, go to command palette (⇧⌘P), type `Markdown PDF: Export (pdf)`. Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

It generates a PDF with support of more content format, e.g., block quotes, auto-inserting page numbers, and contents more compact, but it is significantly slower. <span class="env-orange">It has no TOC.</span>

Pros: It is more compact then MPE + Prince. 

Cons: Slow, does not support TOC, no native math support. 


If you have math in your markdown file, you need to add the following script in the markdown file to render math using MathJax.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script>
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
  MathJax.Hub.Config({ tex2jax: {inlineMath: [['$', '$']]}, messageStyle: "none" });
</script>
```

This is NOT elegent but it is a workaround if you want to print with the Markdown PDF extension.

You can change the CSS for the PDF output by adding a custom CSS file, e.g., `markdown-pdf.css`.

In the `settings.json`, add the following lines:

```css
"markdown-pdf.stylesRelativePathFile": true,
"markdown-pdf.styles": [
    "../assets/css/markdown-pdf.css"
],
```

If you want a full control of the PDF output, you can use Quarto to render the markdown file to PDF.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Markdown+Math

<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath>

Use KaTeX, which is supposedly a fast math renderer.

Function: Simplify the process of authoring and live previewing markdown documents containing math formulas.

Use: Typeset in your markdown source window and see the preview window live updating.

**Define macros for mdmath**

Option 1: use user settings

opt+, open preferences, add your macros directly there.

```json
"mdmath.macros": {
        "\\indep": "{\\perp \\!\\!\\! \\perp}",
        "\\E": "\\mathbb{E}",
},
```

Option 2: save macros in a file and add the file path. The file take priority. That means the defined macros in option 1 will be ignored if a definition file exists.

Issue: This does not work somehow.

```json
"mdmath.macroFile": "/Users/menghan/Documents/mac_setup/config_files/mdmath_macros.json",
```

After adding the macros in preferences, need to restart VS Code to enable them.



___

## Quarto

You can install the Quarto extension from the [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto).

But if you have associated `.qmd` with Markdown previewer as follows

```json
"files.associations": {
   "*.Rmd": "markdown",
   "*.qmd": "markdown",
}
```

then it won't be recognized by the Quarto extension and will be processed as a regular markdown file.

## LaTeX-Workshop

[**LaTeX Workshop**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) is a popular LaTeX extension for Visual Studio Code, providing a comprehensive set of features for LaTeX editing, compiling, and previewing. In the following, I summarize some useful settings and tips for using LaTeX Workshop effectively.

Refer to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2024/08/12/Latex-Workshop.html">LaTeX Workshop</a> for more details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Code Spell Checker

Words not in the dictionary files will have a squiggly underline.

Its configuration starts with `cSpell` in `settings.json`.

In text-based documents like `.md` and `.qmd` files, the spell checker checks all words. In code-based documents like `.py` and `.R` files, the spell checker only checks strings and comments.

Q: How to let cSpell ignore certain environments, such as `code` and `math`? \
A: Add the following to your `settings.json` file:

```json
// Configure spell checker to ignore certain patterns
"cSpell.ignoreRegExpList": [
  "/```[\\s\\S]*?```/g",  // Ignores fenced code blocks (```)
  "/`[^`\\r\\n]*`/g",     // Ignores inline code (`)
  "/@\\w+/g",             // Ignores @ mentions (like @username)
  "/\\$\\$[\\s\\S]*?\\$\\$/g", // Block LaTeX math ($$...$$)
  "/\\$[^$\\r\\n]*\\$/g"  // Inline LaTeX math ($...$)
]
```

- The key is that the inline code config comes **before** the LaTeX patterns. This way, cSpell will first ignore anything in backticks, so `$HOME` (environment variable) inside backticks is not seen as LaTeX math. 


### Customization

The spell checker configuration can be controlled via VS Code preferences or `cspell.json` configuration file. [↩](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)

Order of precedence:

1.  Workspace Folder `cspell.json`
2.  Workspace Folder `.vscode/cspell.json`
3.  VS Code Preferences `cSpell` section.


Words added to the dictionary are placed in the `cspell.json` file in the *workspace* folder. Note, the settings in `cspell.json` will override the equivalent cSpell settings in VS Code's `settings.json`.


Example `cspell.json` file

```json
// cSpell Settings
{
    // Version of the setting file. Always 0.2
    "version": "0.2",
    
    // language locale - current active spelling language
    // "en", "en-US" and "en-GB" are currently supported by default.
    "language": "en-GB",
    
    // words - list of words to be always considered correct
    "words": ["mkdirp", "tsmerge", "githubusercontent", "streetsidesoftware", "vsmarketplacebadge", "visualstudio"],
    
    // flagWords - list of words to be always considered incorrect
    // This is useful for offensive words and common spelling errors.
    // For example "hte" should be "the"
    "flagWords": ["hte"]
}
```

VS Code settings (`settings.json`)

```json
//-------- Code Spell Checker Configuration --------
// The Language locale to use when spell checking. 
// "en", "en-US" and "en-GB" are currently supported by default.
"cSpell.language": "en",
```

Note that when you specify language, the element names are different in `cspell.json` and `settings.json`.

- `language` in `cspell.json`
- `cSpell.language` in `settings.json`

The one in `cspell.json` has higher priority if you specified at both files.

Comments (26-01): The specification in `cspell.json` seems not to work as expected. The spell checker still uses the language specified in `settings.json` even if you have specified a different language in `cspell.json`.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Foreign language support

Here is an example of how to enable Norwegian Bokmål spell checking in VS Code using the Code Spell Checker extension:

1. Install [Norwegian Bokmål](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker-norwegian-bokmal) -- Norwegian Bokmål dictionary extension for VS Code.

2. Adding `nb` to the `cSpell.language` setting, will enable the Norwegian Bokmål dictionary. 
   
   Add the following to your `settings.json` file to enable both English and Norwegian Bokmål spell checking:

   ```json
   "cSpell.language": "en,nb",
   ```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### British English

Install the extension [Code Spell Checker - English (British)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker-british-english)

Then, add the following to your <span class="env-green">**workspace** `settings.json`</span> file:

```json
"cSpell.language": "en-GB",
```

This would enable British English spell checking.

Verify if the language is set correctly by go to Command Palette (⇧⌘P) → `Show Spell Checker Configuration Info`, a side panel will open showing the current configuration.

<div style="height: 400px; overflow-y: auto;">
<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1OhFkDxurkwJG5AsMwiIN_esJcjrbH3WU&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:40%;" />
</div>

If it does not show `en-GB`, make sure you have used the correct workspace `settings.json` file. Sometimes you may have nested project folders, VS Code only recognizes the <span class="env-green">root</span> folder's workspace settings.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Enable CSpell ONLY for certain file types

Q: Code Spell Checker does not check files that are in `gitignore`. How to fix? \
A: Set `"cSpell.useGitignore": false` in `settings.json`.


Q: How to only enable spell checking for certain file types? \
A: Add the following to your `settings.json` file: 

```json
"cSpell.enabledFileTypes": {
  "*": true,         // Enable for all file types
  "bibtex": false    // Disable for bibtex files
},
```

File type `*` means all file types.

The above configuration enables spell checking for all file types except for `bibtex` files.

Alternatively, you can prefix a file type with `!` to disable it, as shown below:

```json
"cSpell.enabledFileTypes": {
  *,
  !bibtex
},
```

<span class="env-orange">A caveat</span> is that `*` covers too comprehensively, but script files such as `.py`, `.r`, etc. should be excluded.

✅ Hence, it is suggested to <span class="env-green">enable spell checking individually</span> for certain file types; 


```json
"cSpell.enabledFileTypes": {
  "rmd": true,
  "markdown": true,
  "plaintext": true,
  "text": true,
  "quarto": true,
  "qmd": true,
  "json": true,
  "bibtex": false           // Disable for bibtex files
},
```

If any file shows CSpell check squiggles *undesirably*, you can disable it by adding the file type to the list with value `false`.

## IntelliSense

[IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/intellisense) is a general term for various code editing features including: code completion, parameter info, quick info, and member lists. IntelliSense features are sometimes called by other names such as "code completion", "content assist", and "code hinting."

The inferred symbols are presented first, followed by the global identifiers (indicated by the `abc` word icon).

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1gqkzo3mHgWLM140lZFbUdohqffb0rNu3&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:60%;" />

The editor supports *tab completion*, which inserts the best matching completion when pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd>.

**Settings**

```json

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Terminal Autocomplete

**Enable autocompletion** 

Q: How to enable code autocomplettion in the terminal? \
A: Set `"terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled": true` in `settings.json`. It supports suggestions for files, folders, commands, command arguments and options in the terminal. 

```json
// Enable command autocompletion, path, command help in Terminal
"terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled": true,
"terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled": true,
```

`"terminal.integrated.shellIntegration.enabled": true,`: the shell integration script should automatically activate on supported shells launched from VS Code. This is done by injecting arguments and/or environment variables when the shell session launches.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Remap keybindings for triggering suggestions**

Manually trigger the code suggestions: defaults to <kbd>⌃Space</kbd>. But it <span class="env-orange">conflicts with other keyboard shortcuts at the OS level</span>, such as default Input Method Editor (IME).

If so, you can rebind the `workbench.action.terminal.triggerSuggest` command with a custom [keybinding](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-editor) (go to the Command Palette (⇧⌘P), and type "**Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts**").

```json
// keybindings.json
{
  "key": "tab",
  "command": "workbench.action.terminal.triggerSuggest",
  "when": "config.terminal.integrated.suggest.enabled && terminalFocus && terminalProcessSupported && !terminalSuggestWidgetVisible"
}
```

This sets the Terminal inline autocomplete trigger to <span class="env-green"><kbd>Tab</kbd></span>. 
Use arrow keys to navigate through suggestions, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to accept.

> You have to make sure that you delete the original keybinding for `"workbench.action.terminal.triggerSuggest"` in `keybindings.json` to avoid conflict.  
> 
> My experience is that if both exist, when I presee <kbd>⌃Space</kbd> (intended to change input method), the input method struggles to switch, sometimes it works, sometimes it does NOT. I had to switch to another app and then switch back to VS Code to make it work again.

<figcaption>VS Code <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration">terminal autocomplete</a> supported by IntelliSense.</figcaption>
</figure>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Suggest as you type**

The default behavior in VS Code is that you need to *manually trigger* the code suggestions by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Tab</kbd> (if you have modified the keybindings as above).

If you want to enable <span class="env-green">automatic suggestions</span> as you type, you can add the following to `setting.json`:

```json
// show automatically depending on the content of the command line
"terminal.integrated.suggest.quickSuggestions": true
```

Read [HERE](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/shell-integration#_intellisense) for more settings about IntelliSense support in the terminal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Terminal Appearance

The look of Visual Studio Code's terminal can be customized extensively.

Settings to customize terminal appearance start with `terminal.integrated.`.

Color customizations can be done via `workbench.colorCustomizations` setting.

[Here](https://glitchbone.github.io/vscode-base16-term/#/) is a useful theme generator for VS Code Terminal. It modifies your `"workbench.colorCustomizations"` in `settings.json`.

For example, the following code customizes the background and text color of the terminal:

```json
"workbench.colorCustomizations" : {
  "terminal.background":"#181818",
  "terminal.foreground":"#D8D8D8",
}
```

## GitHub Copilot

[GitHub Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup) is the AI assistant in VS Code that helps you write code faster and with less effort. It provides code suggestions, autocompletes lines or entire functions, and even generates code based on comments or function names.
**
Commonly used keyboard shortcuts:

- Open chat view: `^⌘I` 
- Start inline chat: `^I` (modified from `⌘I` to avoid conflict with italic style)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Code Completion

[**Code Completion Quick Start**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions#_inline-suggestions)

[Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions#_settings)

- [<span class="codicon codicon-settings-gear dynamic-setting-icon" title="Open 'github.copilot.enable' in Settings Editor"></span> github.copilot.enable](vscode://settings/github.copilot.enable) - enable or disable inline completions for all or specific languages.
- [<span class="codicon codicon-settings-gear dynamic-setting-icon" title="Open 'github.copilot.enable' in Settings Editor"></span> editor.inlineSuggest.fontFamily](vscode://settings/editor.inlineSuggest.fontFamily) - configure the font for the inline completions.
- [<span class="codicon codicon-settings-gear dynamic-setting-icon" title="Open 'github.copilot.enable' in Settings Editor"></span> editor.inlineSuggest.showToolbar](vscode://settings/editor.inlineSuggest.showToolbar) - enable or disable the toolbar that appears for inline completions.
- [<span class="codicon codicon-settings-gear dynamic-setting-icon" title="Open 'github.copilot.enable' in Settings Editor"></span> editor.inlineSuggest.syntaxHighlightingEnabled](vscode://settings/editor.inlineSuggest.syntaxHighlightingEnabled) - enable or disable syntax highlighting for inline completions.

Q: How does **inline suggestions** work?  
A: As you type, GitHub Copilot generates code suggestions in real-time, displaying them as ghost text directly in your editor. You can accept the suggestions by pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> (accept all) or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+ <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> (accept next word), or you can ignore them and continue typing.

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; text-align: center;">
<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1XVHyR2iQK5MTvSuF07rU1W5_o6LoMGl9&sz=w1000" alt="inline suggestions.gif" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />
<figcaption> Git source: @Mark, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/68264996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://stackoverflow.com/a/68264996</a>. Note this is based on Windows. Use <kbd>Cmd</kbd> to replace <kbd>Alt</kbd> on Mac.</figcaption>
</figure>


Q: How to partially accept suggestions? \
A: You might not want to accept an entire suggestion from GitHub Copilot. You can use 

- `⌘→`  to accept the next word of a suggestion, and

- `⌘]` to accept the next line.

  Does <span class="env-orange">NOT</span> work; conflict with system indent.

- Re-mapped to `Alt+]` to accept the next line.
  
  My current `keybindings.json` contains:

  ```json
  // Accept Next Line from GitHub Copilot inline suggestion
  {
    "key": "alt+]",
    "command": "editor.action.inlineSuggest.acceptNextLine",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && inlineSuggestionVisible"
  }
  ```

  Now you can use ⌥+] to accept the next line from GitHub Copilot inline suggestion.

Or you can hover the ghost text, a dialog (see below) will apear, click `…` to Accpet Line.

<figure style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; text-align: center;">
<img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/copilot-hover-highlight.png" alt="GitHub Copilot hover highlight" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 60%;" />
<figcaption> Inline Suggestion Dialog.</figcaption>
</figure>

Q: How to see alternative suggestions? \
A: For any given input, Copilot might offer multiple, alternative suggestions. You can hover over the suggestion and click `<` or `>` to navigate to any of the other suggestions.  Keyboard shortcut: `Option` + `]` to cycle through suggestions.


Q: How to make inline suggestions (ghost text) automatically disappear after a delay if you don’t accept them? \
A: No native support for this feature yet.

Q: ESC which is both used for closing inline suggestions and for entering command mode in Vim, how to avoid conflict? \
A: You can change the keybinding for inline suggestions.

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+u",
  "command": "editor.action.inlineSuggest.hide",
  "when": "editorTextFocus && inlineSuggestionVisible && vim.mode == 'Insert'"
}
```

This will allow you to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> to close inline suggestions while still using <kbd>Esc</kbd> for command mode in Vim.

But, you can just keep on typing to dismiss the inline suggestion. It's not really necessary to close it manually.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Next Edit Suggestion

Copilot next edit suggestions ([Copilot NES](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions#_next-edit-suggestions)) is a feature that provides suggestions for the next edit you might want to make in your code.

<img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/gutter-menu-highlighted-updated.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

- Navigate to the Next suggested code changes with the `Tab` key.
  -  You can then accept a suggestion with the `Tab` key again.
-  An arrow in the gutter indicates if there is an edit suggestion available.

  You can hover over the arrow to explore the edit suggestion menu, which includes keyboard shortcuts and settings configuration:

Q: How to reduce districtions by edit suggestions? \
A: To disable showing the code changes in the editor, enable the [<span class="codicon codicon-settings-gear dynamic-setting-icon" title="Open 'github.copilot.enable' in Settings Editor"></span> editor.inlineSuggest.edits.showCollapsed](vscode://settings/editor.inlineSuggest.edits.showCollapsed) setting in the Settings editor.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Prvent Enter from Submitting

Q: In chat window, set <kbd>Enter</kbd> to line break and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to submit.  
A: Add the following settings to `keybindings.json` (Command Palette, type "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts"):

```json
{
    "key": "shift+enter",
    "command": "workbench.action.chat.submit",
    "when": "inChatInput"
},
{
    "key": "enter",
    "command": "-workbench.action.chat.submit",
    "when": "inChatInput"
},
{
    "key": "enter",
    "command": "editor.action.insertLineAfter",
    "when": "inChatInput"
}
```

`-` before `workbench.action.chat.submit` means to remove the original keybinding for <kbd>Enter</kbd>.  
The leading `–` means unbinding.

To summarize the Enter behavior:

- **Enter** now creates a new line in GitHub Copilot Chat
- **Shift+Enter** submits your message

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Choose AI Correct Model**

| Model type         | Models                                                                     |

| Fast coding        | GPT-4o<br />Claude Sonnet 3.5<br />Claude Sonnet 3.7<br />Gemini 2.0 Flash |
| Reasoning/planning | Claude Sonnet 3.7 Thinking<br />o1<br />o3-mini                            |

[Auto model selection](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2025/09/15/autoModelSelection)


There come limits with your subscription plan. So it's important to optimize model selection to balance performance and cost.
Auto selects the best model to ensure that you get the optimal performance and reduce the likelihood of rate limits. 


When using auto model selection, VS Code uses a variable, [model multiplier, e.g., 1x or 0x after model names](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests#model-multipliers) based on the automatically selected model. If you are a paid user, auto applies a 10% request discount. For example, if auto selects Sonnet 4, it will be counted as 0.9x of a premium request; if auto selects GPT-5-mini, this counts as 0x because the model is included for paid users. You can see which model and model multiplier are used by hovering over the chat response.

If you are a paid user and run out of premium requests, auto will always choose a 0x model (for example, GPT-5 mini), so you can continue using auto without interruption.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Miscellaneous

Q: How to delete chat histories?  
A: When you have a long chat, Copilot takes time to load the conversation history and might get slow. Deleting the history helps Copilot to have quick reactions. In the chat window, click the <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1D0LNpQUiAxzdsyQ2W3anXc3_UREkdBgM&sz=w1000" alt="" style="zoom:5%;" /> icon, it will show history chats in the command palette. You can delete any chats from there. 

Chat histories are stored in `/Users/menghan/Library/Application Support/Code/User/workspaceStorage/[long-serial-number...]/chatSessions`

**Update:** Jan 2026 (version 1.108), you can now right click the chat session in the sidebar to delete it directly.

    "editorGroup": {
        "blame": false,
        "compare": false
    }
},
```


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Restore to Previous Revision

Sidebar > GitLens Inspect > File History, all previous revisions of the file will be listed.

Find the version you want to restore to.
You can open them to view or compare with the current version.

Right click the version you want to restore to, you have two options:

- "Restore Changes (Checkout)" is equivalent to performing a `git checkout <commit-id> <file-path>` or `git restore --source=<commit-id> <file-path>` command. It specifically targets a file and restores its content to the state it was in at a particular commit. This is useful when you want to revert a single file to an earlier version without affecting other files or your current branch.

- "Restore Previous Changes" leverages VS Code's internal file history tracking, which can be useful for recovering lost work or reverting **uncommitted changes**. This is distinct from Git's version control and operates on the local file system's history.

## SQL Server (MSSQL)

FactSet: Connect to Azure SQL with Microsoft Entra authentication and SqlClient

FactSet uses <span style='color:#00CC66'>**Microsoft Entra ID**</span> as the authentication type. Microsoft Entra ID is previously known as [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/new-name)

Microsoft Entra authentication uses identities in Microsoft Entra ID to access data sources such as Azure SQL Database.

`Active Directory Interactive` authentication supports multifactor authentication technology to connect to Azure SQL data sources. If you provide this authentication mode in the connection string, an Azure authentication screen appears and asks the user to enter valid credentials. You can't specify the password in the connection string.

Issue: cannot run SQL notebook as in Azure Data Studio

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How to pad line with dashes until 80 characters long.
A: No quick fix. Can use vim to do this.

1. Select the lines you want to pad.
2. Press `:` to enter the command-line mode and type.
   
   ```vim
   :'<,'>normal 80A-<Esc>81|dw
   ```
   
   Command breakdown:

   - `:'<,'>`: Selects the current visual selection.
   - `normal `: Enters normal mode for the selected lines.
   - `80A-`: Appends at the end of the line a dash (`-`) 80 times
   - `<Esc>`: Exits insert mode.
   - `81|dw`: Moves the cursor to the column 81 (`81|`) and deletes the rest of the line (`dw`, delete until the beginning of next word; dashes count as one word).
   
   Note that `:norm` is a shorthand for `:normal`, which allows you to run normal mode commands on the selected lines. 
3. Press `Enter` to execute the command.

Q: The terminal shows a yellow warning as follows, how to disable it?  

> The following extensions want to relaunch the terminal to contribute to its environment:
> 
> Python Debugger: Enables use of no-config debugging, debugpy <script.py>, in the terminal.

A: This warning appears because the Python Debugger extension wants to modify the terminal environment. Open `settings.json`, add the following line to disable it:

```json
"python.terminal.activateEnvironment": false
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How to disable cursor from blinking?  
A: Set the following in `settings.json`:

```json
"editor.cursorBlinking": "solid",
```

`"editor.cursorBlinking"` controls the cursor animation style. Possible values are: 

- `blink`: The cursor blinks. Default behavior.
- `smooth`: The cursor fades in and out smoothly.
- `phase`: The cursor fades in and out in phases.
- `expand`: The cursor expands and contracts.
- `solid`: The cursor does not blink.

**Boost Your File Tree Visibility**

Make your file explorer folder tree more readable and organized.

Q: How to make the folder tree has larger indentation?  
A: By default, VS Code uses 8 pixels for each indentation level in the Explorer view. To increase the indentation size, you can add the following setting to your `settings.json` file:

```json
// Increase folder tree indentation size to 15 pixels
"workbench.tree.indent": 15,
// Optional:
// Always show the indentation guides
"workbench.tree.renderIndentGuides": "always",
// Change the line color of the indentation guides
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "tree.indentGuidesStroke": "#05ef3c" // Red color for indentation guides
}
```

Recommend [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme). This extension provides good looking file and folder icons in the Explorer view. It helps you to identify different file types and folders quickly.
