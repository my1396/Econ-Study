## [**Push an existing repository**](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/init.html)

1. Initialize an existing project to start tracking with `git`.

   - Go into the directory containing the project.

   - Type `git init`.

   - Type `git add .` to add all of the relevant files. This step is called "staging."
     - You’ll probably want to create a `.gitignore` file right away, to indicate all of the files you don’t want to track. Use `git add .gitignore`, too.
     
   - Type `git commit -m 'commit message'`.

     `commit` records changes to the local repository.

     git generally requires a non-empty commit message.

     

2. Create a online repo and connect it to your local git project.

   <ol type="a">
   <li> Go to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, click the <a href="https://github.com/new">new repository</a> button in the top-right. You’ll have an option there to initialize the repository with a README file.

   </li>
   <li> Click the “Create repository” button. </li>
   <li> Connect your local repo to the remote repo you just created using the following cmds. 
     <pre><code># add repo name "origin" to the remote repo at the URL
   $ git remote add origin https://github.com/my1396/Damage-Function.git
   # rename the "current" local branch to main
   $ git branch -M main 
   # push update from the current local branch (main) to remote (origin) repo's main branch; -u is a shortname for --set-upstream; first parameter is upstream then 2nd parameter is local repo
   # local and remote branch names should be matching
   $ git push -u origin main </code></pre>
   Note that <code>main</code> can be replaced by <code>master</code> for older repositories. 
   </li>
   <li> Then use GitHub Desktop to manage the repo committing, syncing, ..., later on. </li>
   </ol>





**Troubleshooting**

Error: `git pull origin main` returns 

> You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.  
>You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before your next pull:
> 
>`git config pull.rebase false # merge`
> 
>`git config pull.rebase true  # rebase`
> 
>`git config pull.ff only    # fast-forward only`
> 
>fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.

"Divergent branches" 常出现于 remote repo 初始化时不是空的。这种情况下，需要先 `git pull` 合并 remote 和 local，然后再 `git push`。

Fix: run `git pull origin main --rebase`.

## Github common commands

**Documentation**:  <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push>



### **Git Remote Configurations**

`git remote` Creating and modifying git remote configurations

Commonly used `git remote` subcommands:

- Create a **new** connection to a remote repository.

  ```bash
  git remote add <name> <url>
  # Example: add repo name "origin" to the remote repo at the URL
  git remote add origin https://github.com/my1396/Damage-Function.git
  ```

  After adding a remote, you’ll be able to use `＜name＞` as a convenient shortcut for `＜url＞` in other Git commands.

- **Remove** the connection to the remote repository called `＜name＞`.

  ```bash
  git remote rm <name>
  ```

- **Rename** a remote connection from `＜old-name＞` to `＜new-name＞`.

  ```bash
  git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>
  ```

- Show your remotes

  `git remote` without any flags will list previously stored remote connections

  ```bash
  $ git remote
  origin
  ```
  
  `git remote [-v | --verbose]` show remote URL after name. `-v` stands for "verbose."

  ```bash
  $ git remote -v
  origin	https://github.com/my1396/Econ-Study.git (fetch)
  origin	https://github.com/my1396/Econ-Study.git (push)
  ```
  
  `git remote show <remote-repo-name>` give detailed output on the configuration of a remote given by  `<remote-repo-name>`.
  
  ```bash
  $ git remote show origin  
  * remote origin
    Fetch URL: https://github.com/my1396/Econ-Study.git
    Push  URL: https://github.com/my1396/Econ-Study.git
    HEAD branch: main
    Remote branch:
      main tracked
    Local branch configured for 'git pull':
      main merges with remote main
    Local ref configured for 'git push':
      main pushes to main (up to date)
  ```
  
  



___

**Repo's configuration file** 

- Path: `./.git/config`

  `git remote add` command will modify the configuration file.

  You can directly edit the `./.git/config` file with a text editor.

- Looks like the following

  ```bash
  [core]
  	repositoryformatversion = 0
  	filemode = true
  	bare = false
  	logallrefupdates = true
  	ignorecase = true
  	precomposeunicode = true
  [remote "origin"]
  	url = https://github.com/my1396/R-Notes.git
  	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
  [pull]
  	ff = only
  [branch "main"]
  	remote = origin
  	merge = refs/heads/main
  [lfs]
  	repositoryformatversion = 0
  ```

  

___



`git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` 	check is a folder is a git repository. Which will print 'true' to STDOUT if you are in a git repos working tree.

-   Note that it still returns output to STDERR if you are outside of a git repo (and does not print 'false').



___



`fetch`:  downloads commits, files from a remote repository into your local repo, but it doesn't integrate any of this new data into your working files. 

`pull`: fetch + merge.  Directly **integrates** it into your current working copy files.

`git push <repository> <refspec>`: update remote repository with local changes you committed

- `<repository>`     The <u>remote repository</u> that is the destination of a push operation. This parameter can be either a URL or the name of a remote.
- `<refspec>`           The name of the <u>branch in the remote repository</u> where the changes should be pushed. 

You often encounter <span style='color:#00CC66'>`git push origin main`</span> when working with git. Why `origin` and `main`?

- `origin` is the <u>default name given to the remote repository</u> when you clone a repository. 

  It acts as a shorthand for the remote repository’s URL (e.g., a repository hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or another Git server).

  `origin` specifies the remote repository that should receive the changes.

- `main` is the name of a branch in your Git repository. 

  By convention, `main` often serves as the default branch for a repository. It typically contains the latest stable version of the code.

  The branch name specifies which branch in the remote repository should receive the changes. Without specifying the branch, Git might use a default branch or require additional configuration.



___

### Rename

**<span style='color:#00CC66'>Rename</span> a file, a directory, or a symlink**

`git mv [<options>] <source> <destination> `

<u>Renaming or moving files</u> with `git mv` <u>preserves the file’s history</u> and is especially useful in collaborative development to maintain a clear and organized project structure.

- If you do the renaming mannually, the change will be recorded as delete and add a new file, the changes of the file won't be preserved.

```bash
git mv gfg1.py gfg2.py 
```

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1CgtlOAOMsDlELGbSMZDg-FxquXAGkDww&sz=w1000" alt="Git mv" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

**Troubleshooting**

> fatal: not under version control, source=_posts/2023-10-12-Bibli.md, destination=_posts/2023-10-12-Jekyll-Bibli.md

Cause: The error happens because the parent folder has special character (`_posts/`). 

Fix: Try to use absolute path.



___

`git rm` The primary function of `git rm` is to remove tracked files from the Git index. Additionally, `git rm` can be used to remove files from both the staging index and the working directory.

-   `-r` the option is shorthand for '<u>r</u>ecursive'. When operating in recursive mode `git rm` will remove a target directory and all the contents of that directory.
-   `--cached` The `--` separator option is used to explicitly distinguish between a list of file names and the arguments being passed to `git rm`. This is useful if some of the file names have syntax that might be mistaken for other options.
    -   The cached option specifies that the removal should happen only on the staging index. Working directory files will be left alone.

___

Q: Do I need to quote file names?  
A: Depends on your shell, has nothing to do with `git`.

Most shells "tokenize" the command line -- that is, split it into a sequence of discrete elements -- using whitespace. So, for example

```bash
rm one file
```

will attempt to remove a file named `one` and a file named `file`, whereas

```bash
rm 'one file'
```

will attempt to remove a single file named `one file`. 

The principle is

- it does NOT matter whether you quote when your file name/path does NOT contain spaces.
- when you write `commit` messages, usually write inside quotes as it is common to have spaces inside your message.



___



Git doesn't track directories, so it won't remove ones that become empty as a result of a merge or other change. However, you can use `git clean -fd` to remove untracked directories (the `-fd` flag means *f*orce removal of untracked files and directories).

`git restore .`   discards all *unstaged* files in current working directory use.

For one specific file use: `git restore <path/to/file/to/revert>`





___

### gitignore

`foo/` will match a directory `foo` and paths underneath it. `foo` and `/foo` have the same effect. The leading slash doesn't matter.

`*` mathches anything (zero, one, or more characters) except a slash `/`.

`?` mathces one single character except a slash `/`.

A line starting with `#` serves as a comment. Put a backslash ("`\`", escape character) in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.



**Delete a file in `.gitignore` after you have already added it to the repo.**

How to make Git forget about a file that was tracked, but is now in `.gitignore`?

`.gitignore` is only for untracked files.

```bash
# This removes all files from the repository and adds them back (this time respecting the rules in your .gitignore).
git rm -rf --cached "Shared folder.Rproj"
git add .
git commit -m "clear cache"
git push
```

If you make changes to your repository, the workflow is `add` $\rightarrow$ `commit` $\rightarrow$ `push.`



**Undo local changes**

Until you push your changes to a remote repository, changes you make in Git are only in your local development environment.

When you make a change, but have not yet staged it, you can undo your work.

```bash
git reset --hard
```

Undo staged local changes:

```bash
git reset --hard
```

Undo committed local changes. When you commit to your local repository (`git commit`), Git records your changes. Because you did not push to a remote repository yet, your changes are not public (or shared with other developers). At this point, you can undo your changes.



___

## Failure When Push Large Files

Github Error: 

- [RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400 Bad Request](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62753648/rpc-failed-http-400-curl-22-the-requested-url-returned-error-400-bad-request)

- RPC failed; curl 55 Failed sending data to the peer send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet.

This is an HTTP buffer issue. Happens when you are pushing a large amount of data.

**Fix**: 

1. Increase the buffer will solve the issue. [Easiest solution] Or, 
2. you could push by small batches of changes. Or, 
3. use Git Large File Storage. 

```bash
git config http.postBuffer 524288000
git pull && git push
```

Q: what does `http.postBuffer` do?

A: This option changes the size of the buffer that Git uses when pushing data to a remote over HTTP or HTTPS.

> The default of httpBuffer size is set to 1MB for https. Please note the only acceptable values are 524288000 (500mb), 1048576000 (1 GB) and 2147483648 (2 GB). Anything above it, is considered out of range.

`git config http.postBuffer 524288000` will set the httpBuffer size to 500 MB.



To remove the file that you have already committed, you are going to need to reset your HEAD to the commit before the one that contains your file. Make sure you are performing a *soft reset.*

```
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

1 is the number of commits you need to move back, can be greater than 1.



___

### Git Large File Storage

``` ./install.sh.``` install Git Large File Storage from source.

Go to the Git repository where you want to use Git LFS, select the file types you'd like Git LFS to manage (or directly edit your .gitattributes). You can configure additional file extensions at anytime.

```bash
git lfs track "*.psd"
git lfs track "*.png"
```

Now make sure .gitattributes is tracked. Your tracked files’ details are saved inside a `.gitattributes`so make sure to add `.gitattributes` to persist tracking when other users clone the project.

```bash
git add .gitattributes
```

You should then be able to safely add, commit and push!

```bash
git add file.png
git commit -m "Add design file"
git push origin main
```





## **Branch management**

You can also open Pull Requests between separate branches on GitHub. This often presents a good way for <span style='color:#00CC66'>collaborating</span> with people who have access to the same repository. You don't want to all be pushing to the `main` branch all the time. Instead, each person can create their own branch, work separately, and then open a pull request to merge that branch into `main`.

If you create a local branch in your repo, you can push it to GitHub as follows:

First, make sure that you are *on* the branch that you want to push:

```bash
$ git branch
```

Then run 

```bash
# -u option will set up a link between local and remote branches
$ git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

to push the current local (active) branch to the remote branch `<branch-name>`. 

`-u` is a shortname for `--set-upstream`; 

- the 1st parameter is the upstream, 
- the 2nd parameter is the local repo.

Note that branch names should be matching between local and remote repositories. When you run `git push origin main`, Git pushes the commits from your local `main` branch to the corresponding `main` branch on the remote repository.



`git branch` will print a list of branches linked to the current repo. `*` prefix the branch that you have currently checked out (i.e., the branch that `HEAD` points to). 

- could be used to check which branch I am currently on.

- `git branch Menghan` <span style='color:#00CC66'>create a branch</span> called `Menghan`

- `git branch -d Menghan` <span style='color:#00CC66'>delete the local branch</span> `Menghan`

- `git branch -r` show remote branches. Remote branched are just like local branches, except they map to commits from somebody else’s repository. Remote branches are prefixed by the remote they belong to so that you don’t mix them up with local branches. 

  ```bash
  MY-Nuffield:Shared folder Menghan$ git branch -r
    origin/HEAD -> origin/master
    origin/Menghan
    origin/coauthor
    origin/master
  ```

- `git branch -M <main>` rename the current branch to `main`.



`git push <remote> <remote-branch>` Push commits made on your local branch to a remote rep. 

-   E.g., `git push origin main` push your local changes to the remote repository on the  `main` branch. 
    -   Where git push initiates the push, `origin` refers to the remote counterpart of the project, and `main` is the remote branch name. This is common when you are the only contributor to your project, and you want to directly edit the default branch of your project with changes.

-   `<remote>` is the destination remote repo name of a push operation. This parameter can be either a URL or the name of a remote.
    -   When the command line does not specify where to push with the `<remote>` argument, `branch.*.remote` configuration for the current branch is consulted to determine where to push. If the configuration is missing, it defaults to *origin*.
-   `<remote-branch>` is a branch name in the remote repository where the changes should be pushed.

`git push origin <branch>` will push the current branch to the remote counterpart of that branch.

`git push origin` will push the current branch to the branch of the <span style='color:#00CC66'>matching name</span> in the remote repository (aka, “branch configured upstream”), if it exists. 

Otherwise, it will not push and notify that the current branch has no remote counterpart (error message: “\<branchname\> has no upstream branch”).

-   The default branch in your project is conventionally a branch named <span style='color:#00CC66'>"main"</span>. This branch is the version of the project that goes into production or the version from which you will create further branches to isolate changes, and merge back into the default branch.

-   If a project you are working on is older, the default branch might be named “master”, [which GitHub changed to remove references to slavery in conventional terminology.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-to-replace-master-with-alternative-term-to-avoid-slavery-references/) It’s important to check the name of the default branch.

`git push origin` flags

- `-u`, or `--set-upstream`: 

  `git push -u origin main` or `git push --set-upstream origin main`

  Creates a remote branch and sets it upstream of the current branch you are pushing. The relationship between the current branch and upstream branch is remembered, such that you will not have to continually connect the remote and local branches when pushing commits.

  -   It is recommended to use `-u` flag for the first push on a specific branch. When you use the `-u` flag, Git will create a link between your local branch and the remote branch. 
  -   Once a link btw your local and remote branches is created, you don't need to specify repo and branch in the future `pull` and `push`, Git will remember which remote branch corresponds to your local branch.
  
- `-f`, `--force`: 
  Pushes that would delete or overwrite existing code are usually blocked. With this command, pushes from your local repository would be forced onto the remote repository, potentially deleting or overwriting other commits! 

- `-d`, `--delete`:
  Deletes the remote branches listed. Eg, `git push origin --delete <branch name> `

- `--all`:
  Pushes all local branches to remote repository

Solve the `no upstream branch` error message: create a remote branch with the same name as the local branch and push changes to the remote branch (aka, “set upstream”).

-   `$ git push --set-upstream origin `. 







___

### Merge

`git merge <source>` command lets you take the independent lines of development created by `git branch` and integrate them into a single branch.

To do a merge (locally), `git checkout` the branch you want to merge *INTO*. Then type `git merge <branch>` where `<branch>` is the branch you want to merge *FROM*.

```bash
git checkout main # switch to the main branch
git merge new-feature # merge updates in new-feature to main
```



<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1-noV3Hg9FBnIGTTu-D_r6NONM7s93d5O&sz=w1000" alt="image-20230717104452192" style="zoom:50%;" />

When creating a merge commit Git will attempt to auto magically merge the separate histories for you. If Git encounters a piece of data that is changed in both histories it will be unable to automatically combine them. This scenario is a version control conflict and Git will need user intervention to continue. 

Resolve conflicts: `git mergetool ` to check where the conflict occurs and why it occurs. 

- To see that which is the first edited text of the merge conflict in your file, search the file attached with conflict marker **<<<<<<<**. 

  - You can see the changes from the **HEAD** or base branch after the line **<<<<<<< HEAD** in your text editor. 

  - Next, you can see the divider like **=======**. It divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, **followed by >>>>>>> BRANCH-NAME**. In the above example, user1 wrote "<h1> Git is a version control</h1>" in the base or HEAD branch and user2 wrote "<h2> Git is a version control system </h2>".

    <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1RzweNPfcdYvuGb9jp3MRJcCQXRJkkLB4&sz=w1000" alt="image-20230717112204536" style="zoom:50%;" />

  - Decide whether you want to keep only your branch's changes or the other branch's changes, or create a new change. Delete the conflict markers **<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>** and create final changes you want to merge.

To accept the changes, use the `rebase` command. `git rebase --continue ` 







`git checkout <Menghan>` <span style='color:#00CC66'>switch to the branch</span> `Menghan`.

-   `git checkout .` will forgo all unstaged changes.
-   `git checkout -b <new-branch>` create a new branch named `new-branch` and then checked out.

`git branch (-m | -M) [<oldbranch>] <newbranch>`  	`<oldbranch>` will be <span style='color:#00CC66'>renamed</span> to `<newbranch>`. If `<oldbranch>` had a corresponding reflog, it is renamed to match `<newbranch>`, and a reflog entry is created to remember the branch renaming. If `<newbranch>` exists, `-M` must be used to force the rename to happen.

`git remote add <name> <url>` Add a remote named `<name>` for the repository at `<url>`. This is used to configure the remote repo, created a reference using the repo `<url>`.

-   `<name>` is a short remote name for your reference.

-   Now you can pass that remote name `<name>` to `git fetch <name>` to download the contents. 

Fetch a specific branch use `git fetch <remote repo name> <branch name>`. E.g., `git fetch origin test`.

Difference of `fetch` from `pull`: fetch does not merge; pull automatically merge remote to the current branch.



`git update-index --skip-worktree <file>`  causes the following error

> The following pathspecs didn't match any eligible path, but they do match index entries outside the current sparse checkout:

-   If what you want to do is to remove that `<file>` and index entry, unset the `skip-worktree` flag first, with `git update-index --no-skip-worktree "Shared folder.Rproj"`, and then `git rm` will work as expected.

-   If what you want to do is to just remove the index entry, you can do that directly, at the core-command level, `git update-index --force-remove "Shared folder.Rproj"`, or unset the flag as above then `git rm --cached` it.



`git push origin --delete Menghan` delete a remote branch.

`git push -u origin Menghan` push updates from `Menghan` (local)  to `origin` (remote) branch. `-u` is equivalent to `--set-upstream`.



Check **history** on Github

Code $\rightarrow$ History $\rightarrow$ click one commit, this will show your revision history.



Local repository content will change according to which branch you `checkout` in terminal. You make changes at your local branch, then you merge the updates to the `master` branch.

**If your branch is ahead of your master** — You get that message because you made changes in your local master and you didn't push them to remote. You need to navigate to `master` and merge the change from the local branch.

Use the following code to fix the ahead problem.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "My commit"
git checkout master # have to first checkout to master [receiving branch]
git merge Menghan # merge from Menghan --> master
git push -u origin master # push master changes from the current branch to the remote repo master branch.
```



**If your branch is behind your master**: navigate to the local branch and merge change from `master`.
```bash
git checkout master # you are switching your branch to master
git pull # pull update from master
git checkout Menghan # switch back to your branch [receiving branch]
git merge master # from master --> Menghan
```

After merging it, check if there is a conflict or not.
If there is NO CONFLICT then:
```bash
git push
```

If there is a conflict then fix your file(s), then:
```bash
git add yourFile(s)
git commit -m 'updating my branch'
git push
```



To pull a repository from remote
```bash
cd path_for_git_folder
git clone URL
```
