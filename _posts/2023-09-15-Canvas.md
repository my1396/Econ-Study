### Canvas Quizzes

<https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/tkb-p/Instructor#Quizzes>

Multi-part questions

<https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Question-Forum/Multi-part-question-with-numerical-answers/m-p/61887>

To create this I used a text (no question) type for the initial information and then fill in the blank questions for the actual questions. Here's the link to information on quizzes (and quiz questions) that should help - [Quizzes](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-4131#jive_content_id_Quizzes)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Two types of quizzes:**

- Assignment Quizzes: show in gradbook, can be graded, and students can see their results
  - Speed Grader is enabled; Can give feedback to individual students.

- Practice Quizzes
  - Not graded, not shown in gradbook.
  - Can see **Quiz Statistics** and **Moderate This Quiz**.


Q: What's the difference between New Quizzes and Classic Quizzes? \
A: New Quizzes is supposed to have more features, such as screen calculator, but it is still in beta. You need to configure settings for each question... And it takes *forever to load*. I prefer to use **Classic Quizzes** for now because it is more organized.

Q: What good is New Quizzes?

- Can shuffle questions whereas Classic Quizzes only support shuffle answers.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some nice options to tick (Classic Quizzes):

1. Don't forget to **shuffle answers**. Otherwise, the correct answer always show as the first choice.

2. Show all questions at one.

3. Write an instruction at the beginning in case students wonder <span class="env-green">if the quiz counts into the final grade</span>.
   
   > <h4 style="margin:6px 0em;">Instructions</h4>
   > Note: Quizzes do **NOT** count toward the final grade. They are designed to help you understand the material and prepare for the exam and homework.

Q: I set Classic Quizzes as my default quiz type, how can I create a New Quiz type now? \
A: Need to reset Quiz Engine Choice. Click on the Quiz Settings menu button (three vertical dots) in the top right, then select "Reset Quiz Engine Choice".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Table on Canvas

Two options:

1. edit in Excel, use html table generator, paste html code to canvas, and format as you like [time consuming, but best visual effect, clear and neat]

   table $\rightarrow$ code: <https://wordhtml.com> 

   table $\leftrightarrow$ code: <https://divtable.com/generator/>

2. edit in Excel, paste as picture, then save and add the table as picture. [quick but rather blurry] 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Edit math equations on Canvas

1. Use `$$` and `$$` to enclose your equations, then 
2. select and hit the $\sqrt{x}$ symbol. 
3. The eqn editor will automatically convert the eqn for you.



Tip:

- Select ‘Directly Edit LaTeX’ in the Maths Editor to create complex equations. A **preview** of what will be displayed is shown underneath the LaTeX code.



A nice Tutorial how to edit latex on Canvas

<https://ready.msudenver.edu/self-help-tutorials/accessibility/use-mathjax-and-latex-to-display-equations-in-canvas/>

1. Type  the appropriate Delimiter to signal that the equation should be rendered in LaTeX.

   - **`\(`** and **`\)`** should be used for equations that are meant to be displayed **inline** with text.

     When edit quiz questions, use `\(...\)` as delimiters in LaTex. This saves time when you copy and paste from LaTex to Canvas.

   - **`$$`** should be used for equations that are meant to be displayed in separate **blocks**.

2. Type  the Equation between the delimiters.

   - Ex: `\(2+2=4\)` for inline text or `$$2+2=4$$` for block text

3. *Click* **Save** for whatever text field you are working in. 

   The text field won't render the eqn. for you. Only **after** you exit the text field and preview the question, the eqn will show up properly.

4. *Check* that the **Equation** is being displayed correctly.



Can also insert a file into the field box.

### Add images

Use the following codes. Need to number the figures manually.

```html
<figure><img style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom: 20%;" src="/courses/29234/files/1639589/preview" alt="Boxplot for the two groups." />
    <figcaption>Fig. 1 Boxplot for the two groups.<br /><br /></figcaption>
</figure>
```





**Assignment**

Setting up different due dates for one assignment

1. Select Assignment

   <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1OzpbMOP7Ra3JNTI7af3590NuOzZ4SK8e&sz=w1000" alt="Assignment" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

2. Add due date.

   <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1HjHBFnKgFci5qOmeS6MjKRdpNvQ0nmc0&sz=w1000" alt="Assignment" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

3. Choose file type to limit to pdf submissions. Easier for grading.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How to specify the visibility time for a file? \
A: Schedule visibility. 

Go to Files, Click the three dots next to the file you want to schedule (Under Actions column), then click "Edit Permissions", Under available, choose "Schedule availability". 

<img src="https://media.screensteps.com/image_assets/assets/009/399/163/original/26ecd777-f53c-48f0-af67-7f96b71cc447.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

Then you can add the file to corresponding module. The file will only be visible during the scheduled time.
