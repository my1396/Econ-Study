## Notion

Pressing `/` in Notion brings up a full menu of content blocks you can choose to insert. You can shortcut this further by pressing `/` and then typing what you want. 



How to center text: insert a block equation then use `\text{}`.



| Shortcut | Function                   |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| cmd + E  | turn text into inline code |



Add inline equations

- method 1: type 2 dollar signs, i.e., `$$`, followed by your eqn., then close with another 2 dollar signs.
- method 2: type `/inline` equation





Add block eqn: type `/math`

Add quote blocks: type `"` followed by `space` to create a quote block.



## DataCamp

DataCamp Classrooms grant full Teams access for six months for all members of the Classroom. Students and teachers have full access to every piece of content on DataCamp except courses on Tableau and Power BI. Additionally, teachers will have access to Teams admin features in the group dashboard like Assignments, Teams, Leaderboards, Reporting, and more.

### Layout

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1Ibf8FiPU7Ghc_ckzu1btT44VlRFnVJ4d&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

- **Secondary Side Bar** is located toThe left of the editor region. It can be useful to see two views open at the same time. It is often used by the Copilot Chat.
  
- **Editor Groups**
  
  By default, each opened editor goes into the same editor group and open new file as a tab to the right. 
  
  You can create new editor groups in order to group similar or related files, or to allow side by side editing of the same file. 
  
  Create a new editor group by dragging an editor to the side, or using one of the Split commands in the context menu to duplicate the current editor into a new editor group to the left, right, above, or below.

- **Panel** (<kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>)- An additional space for views below the editor region. By default, it contains output, debug information, errors and warnings, and an integrated terminal. The Panel can also be moved to the left or right for more vertical space.



**Custom layout**: <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/custom-layout> 

- Read the webpage to see how to reorganize the default layout

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How to change Panel position?  
A: Right-click on the Panel title bar > Panel Position > choose from Left | Right | Bottom | Top, default is Bottom. Or choose "**View: Toggle Panel Position**" from the Command Palette.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Explorer View**

The [Explorer view](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_explorer-view) is used to browse, open, and manage the files and folders in your project. 

- Type <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (Quick Open) to quickly search and open a file by its name.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Keyboard shortcuts

Command Palette > "**Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts**" to open the Keyboard Shortcuts editor.

| Shortcut             | Function                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `dd`                 | use vim shortcut                                             |
| `cmd` + `J`          | toggle Panel                                                 |
| `ctrl` + `I`         | Github CoPilot: Start inline chat (default shortcut `cmd-I` collapses with italic style) |
| `ctrl` + `cmd` + `I` | open GitHub Copilot chat                                     |
| `opt` + `cmd` + `B`  | close GitHub Copilot chat in the [Secondary Side Bar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/custom-layout#_secondary-side-bar) |
| `cmd` + `P`          | search file names in the current workspace or project.       |
| `shift` + `cmd` + `P`| Bring up the <span class="env-green">**Command Palette**</span> |
| `cmd` + `opt` + `V`  | Markdown Paste: convert rick text to Markdown, such as bold face. |
| `cmd` + `opt` + `C`  | Markdown Paste: paste code with auto-detecting language.     |
| `ctrl` + `I`         | User modified: toggle btw editor and terminal                |



**Useful Extensions:**

- Markdown: `Markdown Preview Enhanced`, `Markdown+Math`, `Markdown All in One`
- TeX: `LaTeX-Workshop` (this installs `intellisense` automatically)
- Spell check, autocomplete: `Code Spell Checker`, `intellisense`



**Extension Reload**

Sometimes you need to reload an extension to apply changes.

Command Palette ‚Üí ‚Äú**Developer: Reload Window**‚Äù

- This is equivalent to restarting VS Code, but it only reloads the current window and does not close the entire application.
- A quick reload ensures that your environment is up-to-date and functioning as intended, preventing potential disruptions in your workflow. 
  - Generally, changes in settings apply immediately, but some settings require a reload to take effect.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Find and Replace in Selection**

1. <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> to open Find/Replace
2. Select your line of text
3. Click the "Find in Selection" icon to the right (or using keyboard shortcut <kbd>opt</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>)
4. Enter your find and replace characters in their inputs
5. Click the "Replace All" icon

Close Find/Replace with <kbd>esc</kbd>.

**Search Across Files**


Press <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> and enter your search term. VS Code will search over all files in the currently opened folder. 

Command Palette approach: enter the **Search: Quick Search** command.

Search results are grouped into files containing the search term, with an indication of the hits in each file and its location. Expand a file to see a preview of all of the hits within that file. Then single-click on one of the hits to view it in the editor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Language Identifiers**

In Visual Studio Code, each [language mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview#_changing-the-language-for-the-selected-file) has a unique specific language identifier. That identifier is rarely seen by the user except in the settings, for example, when associating file extensions to a language:

```json
"files.associations": {
    "*.myphp": "php"
}
```

Note that <span style='color:#008B45'>casing matters</span> for <span style='color:#008B45'>exact identifier</span> matching ('Markdown' != 'markdown')

Every language defines its *id* through the `languages` configuration point in the extension's `package.json` file:

```json
"languages": [{
    "id": "java",
    "extensions": [ ".java", ".jav" ],
    "aliases": [ "Java", "java" ]
}]
```

You can find a list of known identifiers in the [language identifier reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers#_known-language-identifiers).

| Language   | Identifier |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| LaTeX      | `latex`    |
| Markdown   | `markdown` |
| R          | `r`        |
| R Markdown | `rmd`      |
| Quarto     | `quarto`   |

- Note that all identifiers are in lower cases.



___

**Version Control**

Visual Studio Code has integrated source control management (SCM) and includes [Git](https://git-scm.com/) support out-of-the-box.

Use the Source Control icon <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1WI9raE7rHUOpel0q-qKOD0B5DtVWGrc3&sz=w1000" alt="" style="zoom:8%;" /> in the activity bar to access the Source Control view.

Error: No source control providers registered.  
Cause: Git built-in extension was disabled.  
Fix: Go to Extensions, type: `@builtin git`, then **Enable** Git from the Git extension settings.

The Source Control view shows the details of your current repository changes: CHANGES, STAGED CHANGES and MERGE CHANGES.

When you select a file in the Source Control view, you will see the changes that you have made to that file in a diff editor.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=17hy2XUkkIHQ6BytDXQ1raHOYVmq7mcEE&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />



File version control status

- **U** - Untracked file
- **A** - Added file
- **M** - Modified file





___

**Code Actions**

Code Actions can provide both refactorings and **Quick Fixes** for detected issues (highlighted with <span style='color:#EE0000FF'>red squiggles</span>). When the cursor is on a squiggle or on a selected text region, VS Code shows a light bulb icon üí° in the editor to indicate that a Code Action is available. If you select the Code Action light bulb or use the **Quick Fix** command ‚åò., the Quick Fixes and refactorings control is presented.

> If you have enabled GitHub Copilot, you can choose to fix with Copilot. This is a very convenient way to debug your code.

Q: What is *refactoring*?  
A: Visual Studio Code supports refactoring operations (*refactorings*) such as [Extract Method](https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html) and [Extract Variable](https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractVariable.html) to improve your codebase from within the editor. For example, a common refactoring used to avoid duplicating code (a maintenance headache) is the [Extract Method](https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractMethod.html) refactoring, where you select source code and pull it out into its own shared method, so that can reuse the code elsewhere.



___

### Snippets

Snippets files are written in JSON, support C-style comments (`//`), and can define an *unlimited number* of snippets. Snippets support most TextMate syntax for dynamic behavior, intelligently format whitespace based on the insertion context, and allow easy multiline editing.

- a **language** snippet file

  Single-language user-defined snippets are defined in a specific language's snippet file (for example `javascript.json`), which you can access by language identifier through **Snippets: Configure Snippets**. 

  A snippet is only accessible when editing the language for which it is defined.

- a **global** snippet file

  Multi-language and global user-defined snippets are all defined in "global" snippet files (JSON with the file suffix `.code-snippets`), which is also accessible through **Snippets: Configure Snippets**. 

  File path: <span style='color:#008B45'>`$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/snippets`</span>

Create your own snippets: `Code` > `Settings` > `Configure Snippets`

**Syntax**

```json
// in file 'Code/User/snippets/javascript.json'
{
  "For Loop": {
    "prefix": ["for", "for-const"],
    "body": ["for (const ${2:element} of ${1:array}) {", "\t$0", "}"],
    "description": "A for loop."
  }
}
```

- "For Loop" is the snippet name. 

  `prefix` defines <span style='color:#008B45'>**one or more** trigger words</span> that display the snippet in IntelliSense. Substring matching is performed on prefixes, so in this case, "fc" could match "for-const".

  `body` is one or more lines of content, which will be joined as multiple lines upon insertion. Newlines and embedded tabs will be formatted according to the context in which the snippet is inserted.

  `description` is an *optional* description of the snippet displayed by IntelliSense.

  `scope` optional property that takes one or more [language identifiers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/identifiers), which makes the snippet available only for those specified languages. If no `scope` property is given, then the global snippet is available in **all** languages.

- Use `$1`, `$2` to specify cursor locations. The number is the order in which tabstops will be visited, whereas `$0` denotes the final cursor position. 

  The `body` of the example above has three placeholders (listed in order of traversal): `${1:array}`, `${2:element}`, and `$0`. You can quickly jump to the next placeholder with <kbd>Tab</kbd>.

  `$0` is an optional special case that always comes last.

- **Placeholders** are tabstops with values, like `${1:foo}`. The placeholder text will be inserted and selected such that it can be easily changed. Placeholders can be nested, like `${1:another ${2:placeholder}}`.

  The string after the colon `:` (if any) is the default text. 

- **Variables**: With `$name` or `${name:default}`, you can insert the value of a variable. 

  - <span style='color:#008B45'>`TM_SELECTED_TEXT`</span> The currently selected text or the empty string.

-  With `\` (backslash), you can escape `$`, `}`, and `\`. 
- Multilined `body`: simply wrap each line with double quotes.

Q: When using `$TM_SELECTED_TEXT`, if you type the prefix, the selected text will be overwritten. What to do with it?  
A: VS code remembers the text. When you finish typing the prefix, the formatted text will show up accordingly.

```json
// customer defined snippets
{
  "Colored Span Green": {
    "prefix": "cs-green",
    "body": [
      "<span style=\"color: #008B45;\">$TM_SELECTED_TEXT</span>$0"
    ],
    "description": "Insert a green colored span"
  },
  "Math Helper Parentheses": {
    "scope": "markdown, latex",
    "prefix": "\\(",
    "body": [
      "\\left($1\\right)$0"
    ],
    "description": "Insert parentheses with LaTeX math formatting"
  },
  "Math Helper Brackets": {
    "scope": "markdown, latex",
    "prefix": "\\[",
    "body": [
      "\\left[$1\\right]$0"
    ],
    "description": "Insert brackets with LaTeX math formatting"
  },
}
```

- `"scope": "markdown, latex"` set `scope` to  `"markdown, latex"` such that `\(` works inside dollar signs.

- To [escape double backslashes](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/33933#issuecomment-328793257), you have to use `\\\\\\\\` (8 backslashes).
  - In TextMate you *can* but must not escape a backslash with a backslash, so to insert 1 backslash have either `\` or `\\`
  - In JSON you *must* escape a backslash with another backslash, so to insert 1 backslash have either `\\` or `\\\\`, to insert 2 `\\\\\\\\`

**List of user defined snippets:**

| prefix                           | command           |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `cs-green` / `cs-red`/ `cs-blue` | colored html span |
| `\(`                             | `\left(\right)`   |
| `\[`                             | `\left[\right]`   |
| `vec`                            | row vector        |
| `cvec`                           | column vector     |
| `mat`                            | variance matrix   |

Q: Is it possible to set max lines of a table printed in notebook?  
A: The simple answer is NO. Seetings ‚Üí Features ‚Üí Notebook only limits the cell size of a pure text based output. It does NOT apply to outputs such as matrices, dataframes or other spreadsheet-like outputs (e.g. from the `View()` function in R.)


___

### Configuration

[Change settings of VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings)

- **Menu bar**: Code ‚Üí Settings (keyboard shortcut: <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>)
  
  A useful feature is to copy the json for the settings of interest in the UI. 

  <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=10iN98_ZJ4sUFzOngKsFMCxZxGldixVOA&sz=w1000" alt="copy as json" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

  When you hover over the **title** of the setting, a gear icon <span class="codicon codicon-settings-gear dynamic-setting-icon"></span> will appear, choose "Copy Setting as JSON" to copy the setting in json format.

- **Configuration file**: change directly in the user settings file (`settings.json`)

**Setting file locations**: 

- **macOS User Settings:** Global settings that apply to **all VS Code workspaces and projects**

  Located in the user's home directory in the VS Code application data folder: `$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json`

  Examples: Theme, font size, editor preferences, extensions settings, etc.

  Lower priority (can be overridden by workspace settings)

- **Workspace Settings:** Project-specific settings that apply only to the current workspace/project.

  Located in `.vscode/settings.json` inside the project folder.

  Examples: Project-specific linting rules, build configurations, language settings for this project

  **Priority**: Higher priority (overrides user settings)


You can toggle between User and Workspace Settings by choosing the tab in the UI or if you are using the json file, you can determine which settings you are working on by looking at the file path.


Run `Open Config Script` to open `config.js` (a JavaScript configuration file):

- define TeX macros `KatexConfig`, `mathjaxConfig` ...



Q: What is the [difference between `.json` and `.js`](https://www.koombea.com/blog/json-vs-javascript/)?  
A: `.json` is a subset of `.js`, which stands for JavaScript. 

- If you store only data, use `.json`; 

  You can think of `.json` as a YAML frontmatter in markdown.

- if you have some sort of logic (functions, conditions, loops ...), use `.js`.



Q: How to customize language-specific setttings?  
A: Open User Settings ‚Üí Type `@lang:markdown` into the search widget. This will show configurable settings for that specific language. Alternatively, you can change directly in the settings JSON file.

```json
"[markdown]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "editor.renderWhitespace": "all",
    "editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": "off"
  }
```





Q: How to **preview a markdown file**?  
A: Two options:

- Open Preview (‚áß‚åòV)
- Open Preview to the Side (‚åòK V)

Use either the keyboard shortcuts or click the Preview button. 

- Double clicking an element in the Markdown preview will automatically open the editor for the file and scroll to the line nearest the clicked element.

To set **html preview** using external browser, you need to change setting for the two extensions:

- Quarto Preview: personally I prefer to use the build-in preview as it basically provides a live preview just like *Markdown Preview Enhanced*.
- Live Preview: set to external browser, as Live Preview is more often used to preview the whole website.


___

Q: How to open the User settings json file?  
A: Follow the following steps:

1. Open the Command Palette (either with F1 or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>)
2. Type *"open settings"*
3. You are presented with a few options, choose **Open User Settings (JSON)**

You can change setting using the UI or there is a `settings.json` file which saves all configurations.

VS Code includes a button in the Settings UI gutter which can be used to switch between JSON and graphical view.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1-l2nIxBZuTRE5_zHkirjS4HzZ_5c-be5&sz=w1000" alt="VS Settings" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />



Q: How to spell check code and document?  
A: Use the extension [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker). Put your cursor in the word, use `Cmd`+`.` to show suggestions and select.

Q: How to ignore unknown words?  
A: Go to Settings (‚åò,) ‚Üí `cSpell.diagnosticLevel` ‚Üí Choose `Hint`  from the drop down menu. 

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1ZxDhrGmvNKGtokZ88epXUw7zw7hEG3Dl&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:60%;" />



Q: How to show my installed extensions?  
A: By default, the Extensions view will show the extensions you currently have installed, and all extensions that are recommended for you. You can use the **Extensions: Focus on Installed View** command, to show the installed ones.



Q: Disable <kbd>Enter</kbd> to accept suggestions as this confuses inserting a new line.  
A: Set **Editor: Accept Suggestion On Enter** to `off`. 



___

### Markdown

**Markdown Preview Settings**: <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview>


Q: How to get a preview of Rmarkdown?  
A: Open `settings.json`, add the following code inside the braces.

```json
/* this adds additional file extensions to markdown */
"files.associations": {
    "*.Rmd": "markdown",
    "*.qmd": "markdown",
},
```

A drawback of this setting is that you cannot run codes inside the markdown files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: How to get autocomplete, syntax highlighting in Markdown?  
A: Install `Latex Workshop` by James Yu ‚Üí Switch Language Mode from `Markdown` to `markdown_latex_combined`.

This will disable markdown preview! Therefore, not recommended. ‚ùå

Use `Markdown All in One` extension instead. ‚úÖ


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How to change the language for the selected file?  
A: In the status bar, click the language indicator. This will bring up the **Select Language Mode** dropdown where you can select another language for the current file.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1d1R_ErtbQeWARja7SbsTsusiP_5Z5hS1&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:120%;" />



Q: How to change [Markdown preview security](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview-security)?  
A: You can change what content is allowed in the Markdown preview by clicking on the popup or running the `Markdown: Change preview security settings` command in any Markdown file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


**Visual Mode and Source Mode**

Visual Mode has inline preview of eqns, and in time preview of your markdown, like in Typora.

Side-to-side preview can be slow and the previewer can crash for a large file. That's where Visual Mode comes in handy.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1j_Btjvfn-PXR6lnNvIafGh4EOo1mK_xW&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />





___

### Markdown Preview Enhanced

Q: How to define MathJax macros?  
A: You can configure MathJax by running command `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open MathJax Config`.



Q: How to set Math Rendering Engine?  
A: Run command `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Math Rendering Option`.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1rH7Yf7_8nzpEoHKeqnKBfRPSRzj4JE41&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

References:

- <https://github.com/shd101wyy/vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced/issues/67>



Q: How to enable automatic numbering for MathJax?  
A: Run `Open Config Script` (will open `config.js`, a JavaScript configuration file), and add 

```js
mathjaxConfig: {
  tex: {
    tags: 'ams',
    "macros": {
        bold: ["{\\boldsymbol #1}", 1], // use \bold as a shorthand
        indep: "{\\perp \\!\\!\\! \\perp}",
        // bold face capital letter
        bA: "\\boldsymbol{A}",
    }
  }
};
```

to tell the TeX input processor to use the AMS **numbering** rules (where only certain environments produce numbered equations, as they would be in LaTeX, e.g., `\begin{equation}`).

You can use `\notag` or `\nonumber` to prevent individual equations from being numbered, and `\tag{}` can be used to override the usual equation number with your own symbol instead (or to add an equation tag even when automatic **numbering** is off).

You can also define your TeX macros in `config.js`.

File path: `/Users/menghan/.local/state/crossnote/config.js`



Q: How to use dark theme for Markdown Preview Enhanced (MPE)?  
A:  Run command `Markdown Preview Enhanced: Preview Theme`, choose `github-dark.css`.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1cyw-XBsexYGX08gR79k0WqjvRC9gH1f4&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />



Q: How to get separate preview for individual files?  
A:  MPE has one preview tab for all files by default. You can change this by going to preferences > Markdown Preview Enhanced > Preview Mode > Set to Multiple Previews. Restart VS Code to activate the setting.

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1eCCWZT7c8UZA3o_WpTRGP8xsfN6tfvrX&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

### Markdown+Math

<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath>

Use KaTeX, which is supposedly a fast math renderer.

Function: Simplify the process of authoring and live previewing markdown documents containing math formulas.

Use: Typeset in your markdown source window and see the preview window live updating.

**Define macros for mdmath**

Option 1: use user settings

opt+, open preferences, add your macros directly there.

```json
"mdmath.macros": {
        "\\indep": "{\\perp \\!\\!\\! \\perp}",
        "\\E": "\\mathbb{E}",
},
```

Option 2: save macros in a file and add the file path. The file take priority. That means the defined macros in option 1 will be ignored if a definition file exists.

Issue: This does not work somehow.

```json
"mdmath.macroFile": "/Users/menghan/Documents/mac_setup/config_files/mdmath_macros.json",
```

After adding the macros in preferences, need to restart VS Code to enable them.



___

### Quarto

You can install the Quarto extension from the [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto).

But if you have associated `.qmd` with Markdown previewer as follows

```json
"files.associations": {
   "*.Rmd": "markdown",
   "*.qmd": "markdown",
}
```

then it won't be recognized by the Quarto extension and will be processed as a regular markdown file.

### LaTeX-Workshop

Snippets: <https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Snippets#Handy-mathematical-snippets>

The following works in `markdown` inside math environment

| Prefix | Command |
| ------ | ------- |
| `__`   | `_{$1}` |
| `**`   | `^{$1}` |
| `...`  | `\dots` |

Environment snippets works directly in `tex`, you type `B`, a drop-down list will show up for you to choose.

- The prefixes start with `B` and are followed by an abbreviation of the environment name.
- The unnumbered versions of the environments are prefixed with `BS`, e.g., `BSEQ` for `equation*`.
- In `tex`, these cmds work in both math and text environments.
- However, it is more restrictive in markdown, where these cmds work only inside math environments (`$...$`)



| Prefix | Environment name                           |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| <span class="env-green">`BEQ`</span>  | `equation`  |

[`@` suggestsion](https://github.com/James-Yu/latex-workshop/wiki/Intellisense#-suggestions)

LaTeX-Workshop provides an independent intellisense mechanism triggered by `@`. For example, you can type `@a` for `\alpha`. It works for most Greeks and have some useful mathematical helpers.

| Prefix | Command               |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| `@(`   | `\left( $1 \right)`   |
| `@{`   | `\left\{ $1 \right\}` |
| `@[`   | `\left[ $1 \right]`   |
| `@^`   | `\Hat{$1}`            |
| `@_`   | `\bar{$1}`            |

### Code Spell Checker

Words not in the dictionary files will have a squiggly underline.

Its configuration starts with `cSpell`.

In text-based documents like `.md` and `.qmd` files, the spell checker checks all words. In code-based documents like `.py` and `.R` files, the spell checker only checks strings and comments.

Q: How to let cSpell ignore certain envoronments, such as `code` and `math`? \
A: Add the following to your `settings.json` file:

```json
// Configure spell checker to ignore certain patterns
"cSpell.ignoreRegExpList": [
  "/```[\\s\\S]*?```/g",  // Ignores fenced code blocks (```)
  "/`[^`\\r\\n]*`/g",     // Ignores inline code (`)
  "/@\\w+/g",             // Ignores @ mentions (like @username)
  "/\\$\\$[\\s\\S]*?\\$\\$/g", // Block LaTeX math ($$...$$)
  "/\\$[^$\\r\\n]*\\$/g"  // Inline LaTeX math ($...$)
]
```

- The key is that the inline code config comes **before** the LaTeX patterns. This way, cSpell will first ignore anything in backticks, so `$HOME` (environment variable) inside backticks is not seen as LaTeX math. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Foreign language support**

Here is an example of how to enable Norwegian Bokm√•l spell checking in VS Code using the Code Spell Checker extension:

1. Install [Norwegian Bokm√•l](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker-norwegian-bokmal)¬†-- Norwegian Bokm√•l dictionary extension for VS Code.

2. Adding¬†`nb`¬†to the¬†`cSpell.language`¬†setting, will enable the Norwegian Bokm√•l dictionary. Example using both English and Norwegian Bokm√•l dictionaries:

   ```json
   "cSpell.language": "en,nb",
   ```

### [Intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/intellisense)

IntelliSense is a general term for various code editing features including: code completion, parameter info, quick info, and member lists. IntelliSense features are sometimes called by other names such as "code completion", "content assist", and "code hinting."

The inferred symbols are presented first, followed by the global identifiers (indicated by the `abc` word icon).

The editor supports *tab completion*, which inserts the best matching completion when pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd>.

**Settings**

```json
// Controls if quick suggestions should show up while typing
"editor.quickSuggestions": {
    "other": true,
    "comments": false,

</figure>


Q: How to partially accept suggestions? \
A: You might not want to accept an entire suggestion from GitHub Copilot. You can use 

- `‚åò‚Üí`¬† to accept the next word of a suggestion, and

- `‚åò]` to accept the next line.

  Does NOT work; conflict with system indent.

Or you can hover the ghost text, a dialog (see below) will apear, click `‚Ä¶` to Accpet Line.

<figcaption> Inline Suggestion Dialog.</figcaption>
</figure>

Q: How to see alternative suggestions? \
A: For any given input, Copilot might offer multiple, alternative suggestions. You can hover over the suggestion and click `<` or `>` to navigate to any of the other suggestions.  Keyboard shortcut: `Option` + `]` to cycle through suggestions.


Q: How to make inline suggestions (ghost text) automatically disappear after a delay if you don‚Äôt accept them? \
A: No native support for this feature yet.

Q: ESC which is both used for closing inline suggestions and for entering command mode in Vim, how to avoid conflict? \
A: You can change the keybinding for inline suggestions.

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+u",
  "command": "editor.action.inlineSuggest.hide",
  "when": "editorTextFocus && inlineSuggestionVisible && vim.mode == 'Insert'"
}
```

This will allow you to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> to close inline suggestions while still using <kbd>Esc</kbd> for command mode in Vim.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Next Edit Suggestion

Copilot next edit suggestions ([Copilot NES](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/ai-powered-suggestions#_next-edit-suggestions)) is a feature that provides suggestions for the next edit you might want to make in your code.

<img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/copilot/inline-suggestions/gutter-menu-highlighted-updated.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

- Navigate to the Next suggested code changes with the¬†`Tab`¬†key.
  -  You can then accept a suggestion with the `Tab` key again.
-  An arrow in the gutter indicates if there is an edit suggestion available.

  You can hover over the arrow to explore the edit suggestion menu, which includes keyboard shortcuts and settings configuration:

Q: How to reduce districtions by edit suggestions? \
A: To disable showing the code changes in the editor, enable the¬†[<span class="codicon codicon-settings-gear dynamic-setting-icon" title="Open 'github.copilot.enable' in Settings Editor"></span> editor.inlineSuggest.edits.showCollapsed](vscode://settings/editor.inlineSuggest.edits.showCollapsed)¬†setting in the Settings editor.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Q: How to delete chat histories?  
A: When you have a long chat, Copilot takes time to load the conversation history and might get slow. Deleting the history helps Copilot to have quick reactions. In the chat window, click the <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1D0LNpQUiAxzdsyQ2W3anXc3_UREkdBgM&sz=w1000" alt="" style="zoom:5%;" />  icon, it will show history chats in the command palette. You can delete any chats from there. 

Chat histories are stored in `/Users/menghan/Library/Application Support/Code/User/workspaceStorage/[long-serial-number...]/chatSessions`




Q: In chat window, set <kbd>Enter</kbd> to line break and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> to submit.  
A: Add the following settings to `keybindings.json` (Command Palette, type "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts"):

```json
{
    "key": "shift+enter",
    "command": "workbench.action.chat.submit",
    "when": "inChatInput"
},
{
    "key": "enter",
    "command": "-workbench.action.chat.submit",
    "when": "inChatInput"
},
{
    "key": "enter",
    "command": "editor.action.insertLineAfter",
    "when": "inChatInput"
}
```

To summarize the Enter behavior:

- **Enter** now creates a new line in GitHub Copilot Chat
- **Shift+Enter** submits your message

### SQL Server (MSSQL)

FactSet: Connect to Azure SQL with Microsoft Entra authentication and SqlClient

FactSet uses <span style='color:#00CC66'>**Microsoft Entra ID**</span> as the authentication type. Microsoft Entra ID is previously known as [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/fundamentals/new-name)

Microsoft Entra authentication uses identities in Microsoft Entra ID to access data sources such as Azure SQL Database.

`Active Directory Interactive` authentication supports multifactor authentication technology to connect to Azure SQL data sources. If you provide this authentication mode in the connection string, an Azure authentication screen appears and asks the user to enter valid credentials. You can't specify the password in the connection string.

Issue: cannot run SQL notebook as in Azure Data Studio

Q: How to pad line with dashes until 80 characters long.
A: No quick fix. Can use vim to do this.

1. Select the lines you want to pad.
2. Press `:` to enter the command-line mode and type.
   
   ```vim
   :'<,'>normal 80A-<Esc>81|dw
   ```
   
   Command breakdown:

   - `:'<,'>`: Selects the current visual selection.
   - `normal `: Enters normal mode for the selected lines.
   - `80A-`: Appends at the end of the line a dash (`-`) 80 times
   - `<Esc>`: Exits insert mode.
   - `81|dw`: Moves the cursor to the column 81 (`81|`) and deletes the rest of the line (`dw`, delete until the beginning of next word; dashes count as one word).
   
   Note that `:norm` is a shorthand for `:normal`, which allows you to run normal mode commands on the selected lines. 
3. Press `Enter` to execute the command.
