## Google Colab

Go to the main page of [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), then upload your local `.ipynb` file. This will create a copy of the notebook in your Google Drive and the file is opened by Google Colab by default. Successfully recognized file will show an icon <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/google-colab.svg" alt="" style="zoom:80%;" /> before file names.

If you directly upload to Google Drive, you need to right-click on the file, then choose "Open with" > "Google Colaboratory". This creates issues when you share the file with others. They will see a bunch of json code until they choose to "Open with" > "Google Colaboratory".
