**Canvas Quizzes**

<https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Instructor-Guide/tkb-p/Instructor#Quizzes>

Multi-part questions

<https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Canvas-Question-Forum/Multi-part-question-with-numerical-answers/m-p/61887>

To create this I used a text (no question) type for the initial information and then fill in the blank questions for the actual questions. Here's the link to information on quizzes (and quiz questions) that should help - [Quizzes](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-4131#jive_content_id_Quizzes)

Some nice options to tick

1. Don't forget to **shuffle answers**. Otherwise, the correct answer always show as the first choice.

2. Show all questions at one.

**Table in Canvas**

Two options:

1. edit in Excle, use html table generator, paste html code to canvas, and format as you like [time consuming, but best visual effect, clear and neat]

   table $\rightarrow$ code: <https://wordhtml.com> 

   table $\leftrightarrow$ code: <https://divtable.com/generator/>

2. edit in Excle, paste as picture, then save and add the table as picture. [quick but rather blurry]
