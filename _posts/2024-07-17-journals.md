## Publishing

Norwegian Scientific Level [Search Page](https://kanalregister.hkdir.no/en?option=journals&input=)

Publication Channels (Norweigian Publication Indicator or Kanalregisteret): <https://kanalregister.hkdir.no/en/informasjonsartikler/expressions-and-abbreviations>

Academic publication channels mean publishers that have been approved by the national publishing committee and been entered into the [Norwegian register for scientific journals, series and publishers](https://kanalregister.hkdir.no/publiseringskanaler/Forside). Academic publication channels are categorised as level 1 and level 2 channels, where level 2 gives the highest score of publication points.

> Should only publish in level 2 journals.

- [Level 1 and level 2](https://kanalregister.hkdir.no/en/informasjonsartikler/levels-and-changes-in-levels) means that the publication channels are recognised as approved academic publication channels. 

  - Level 2 is approved as an academic publication channel at the highest level.

    The limit for Norwegian level 2 is for journals registered in the Academic Journal Guide (AJG) from CABS (Chartered Association of Business School, or often referred to as *ABS ranking*) in the upper half of AJG/ABS, i.e., ranked as 3, 4, or 4*. 

    For instance, AJG=1 or 2 is automatically at Norwegian level 1 and AJG=4 or 4* is automatically at Norwegian level 2.

- Level 0 means that the publication channel is not approved as academic publication channel.



Journals by scientific disciplines: <https://npi.hkdir.no/fagfeltoversikt>

Kanalregisteret gives you an overview of which publications may give credits in the Norwegian allocation system for publication points.

- If scientific level is 1 or 2 it means the scholarly level is evaluated as satisfactory by the Directorate and may allocate points to the university. 

- The list also gives you information about Open Access. Look up a journal, see information for Open Access under Sherpa Romeo and DOAJ, or if there is a publishing agreement (*A)*. 

  Publishing agreements: Agreements negotiated by Sikt with selected publishers, or agreements contracted between institutions and publishers to publish open access. The journals covered by these agreements are marked with A. Read about the agreements Sikt negotiates at 10.1 www.openscience.no. 



**Publiseringspoeng**

**Publication points** are allocated on the basis of the number of author’s shares credited to your institution. For each publication the sum of points will be determined by the number of co-authors and author’s shares, type of publication (monograph, chapter, article), the level of the publication channel and whether international co-authors have contributed or not.

The base weighting for academic articles in journals or series (with ISSN)

- level 1: 1 pt 
- level 2: 3 pt.

Q: What does **Author Shares** mean?



All authors and addresses listed in a publication will be given equal weight. 

The calculation is thus based on the number of authors of the publication according to the following formula:

- A publication with 1 author is worth 1 point.

- A publication with n authors is worth 1/n point for each author, but the value must be at least 1/10 point. (Fractions are not used when there are more than 10 authors.)

- An institution is granted the sum of the point values from those authors who credit the institution.

#### **Impact factor**

- Or Journal Impact Factor, is often used to say something about the publication channel’s impact in the research community.
- Is a measure of the number of citations a journal has had within a specific year.
- The more citations, the higher the impact factor.
- Is calculated based on the two previous years.
- Is often a part of what one evaluates in the level 2-nomination. See the [NPI website](https://npi.hkdir.no/informasjon#fagfeltnoytralitet).

[ABS (Association of Business Schools) ranking](https://charteredabs.org/academic-journal-guide/academic-journal-guide-2024): 4* (a world elite journal); 4 (a top journal); 3 (a highly regarded journal); 2 (a well-regarded journal); and 1 (a recognized journal).

Q: Where do I find the ABS journal list?  
A: The Chartered Association of Business Schools (ABS) regularly produce a guide to academic journals published within the Business and Management field. This includes a list of all relevant journals, each of which have been evaluated and assigned a star rating to indicate their quality.

You can access the [ABS guide to academic journals](https://charteredabs.org/academic-journal-guide) (AJG) for free, though you will need to register first.

Checklists:

- [Code and Software submission checklist](https://www.nature.com/documents/nr-software-policy.pdf) *****
- [Editorial policy checklist](https://www.nature.com/documents/nr-editorial-policy-checklist.pdf) *****

Forms marked with ***** are dynamic ‘smart pdfs’ and <span style='color:#FF9900'>won't open directly in a conventional browser</span>. These <span style='color:#00CC66'>must be downloaded</span> and <span style='color:#00CC66'>opened in *Adobe Reader*</span> or similar.

<https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/formatting-guide>

[Initial Submissions](https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/initial-submission)

The <span style='color:#00CC66'>**Nature journals are flexible with regard to the format of initial submissions**</span>. 

- Within reason, <u>style and length</u> will not influence consideration of a manuscript. 
- If revisions are requested, the editor will provide detailed formatting instructions at that time.

The typical length of an 8-page article with 5-6 modest display items (figures and tables) is <span style='color:#00CC66'>**4300 words**</span>. 

- A ‘modest’ display item is one that, with its legend, occupies about **a quarter of a page** (equivalent to ~270 words). 

- If a composite figure (with several panels) needs to occupy at least half a page in order for all the elements to be visible, the text length may need to be reduced accordingly to accommodate such figures. 

Keep in mind that essential but technical details can be moved into the Methods or Supplementary Information.

**Methods**

The ‘Methods’ section is in the main text file, following the figure legends. This Methods section will appear in the PDF and in the full-text (HTML) version of the paper online, but will not appear in the printed issue. 

The Methods section should be written as concisely as possible but should contain all elements necessary to allow interpretation and replication of the results. As a guideline, the Methods section does not typically exceed 3,000 words.

The Methods section **cannot** contain figures or tables (essential display items should be included in the Extended Data or exceptionally in the Supplementary Information).

**Extended Data**

Extended Data <span style='color:#00CC66'>**figures and tables**</span> are online-only (appearing in the online PDF and full-text HTML version of the paper), peer-reviewed display items that provide essential background to the Article but are not included in the printed version of the paper due to space constraints or being of interest only to a few specialists.

<span style='color:#00CC66'>**For initial submission you may include Extended Data items as regular display items in the body of the manuscript or as Supplementary Information**</span>. 

Up to 10 multi-panel Extended Data display items.

If the main finding includes a complex process we encourage the inclusion of a schematic to aid readers unfamiliar with the topic. [flow chart to display the process]

**Supplementary Information**

Supplementary Information (SI) is online-only, peer-reviewed material that is essential background to the Article (for example, large data sets, methods, calculations), but which is too large or impractical, or of interest only to a few specialists, to justify inclusion in the printed version of the paper. See the [Supplementary Information page](http://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/supp-info) for further details.

- Supplementary Information should NOT contain figures (any figures additional to those appearing in print should be formatted as Extended Data figures). 

- Tables may be included in Supplementary Information, but only if they are unsuitable for formatting as Extended Data tables (for example, tables containing large data sets or raw data that are best suited to Excel files).



**Hierachy** in Nature, Nature subject journals

- A publication in *Nature* itself is obviously the most prestigious and is roughly equivalent with publishing in the most respected journal in your field.

  8-page article with 5-6 display items, approximately <span style='color:#00CC66'>**4300 words**</span>.

- *Nature* subject journals are a tier below *Nature*, but are also extremely prestigious and can allow young PhD students and postdocs to break into permanent research positions.

  - [*Nature Climate Change*](https://www.nature.com/nclimate/content#:~:text=Nature%20Climate%20Change%20welcomes%20ideas%20for%20future%20topics.&text=Length%20–%20up%20to%203%2C000%20words,and%20figures%20is%20strongly%20encouraged.)  \\
    Main text – up to <span style='color:#00CC66'>**3,000 words**</span>, excluding abstract, online Methods, references and figure legends. \\
    Abstract – up to 150 words, unreferenced.  \\
    Display items – <span style='color:#00CC66'>**up to 6 items (figures and/or tables)**</span>. The number of display items should be commensurate with the word length. Rule of thumb: one display item each 500 words. \\
    <span style='color:#00CC66'>**Sections**</span>: Introduction (without heading) $\rightarrow$ Results (divided by topical subheading) $\rightarrow$ Discussion (does not contain subheadings) $\rightarrow$ Online Methods \\
    Methods doesn not count into the main text word. Typically less than <span style='color:#00CC66'>3000 words</span>.
  - [*Nature Geoscience*](https://www.nature.com/ngeo/content#:~:text=The%20main%20criteria%20are%20that,accessible%2C%20non%2Dtechnical%20style.&text=%E2%80%8BLength%20–%20varies%2C%20but%20typically,1%2D2%20items%20are%20encouraged.) \\
    Main text – usually no longer than <span style='color:#00CC66'>**2,200 words**</span>, but can be up to 3,000 words at the editor’s discretion (excluding abstract, Methods, references and figure legends). \\
    Abstract – up to 200 words, unreferenced. \\
    Title – up to 90 characters (including spaces). \\
    Display items – 4-6 items (figures and/or tables). \\
    Results and Discussion material should be divided by 3-4 topical subheadings that are brief, but informative; the online Methods should also be divided by topical subheadings.

- [*Nature Communications*](https://www.nature.com/ncomms/submit/article) is a respectable "[megajournal](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/04/05/the-newish-kids-on-the-block-touring-the-megajournals/)" a tier below the subject journals. It accepts a larger number of publications. \\
  Main text (not including Abstract, Methods, References and Figure legends) should be limited to <span style='color:#00CC66'>**5,000 words**</span>. \\
  *Nature Communications* is flexible with regard to the format of initial submissions. Within reason, style and length will not directly influence consideration of a manuscript. We also do not require a particular structure or format at first submission. If and when revisions are required, the editor will provide detailed formatting instructions at that time. 



**Sections**

1. Introduction

   Referenced text that expands on the background of the work (some overlap with the abstract is acceptable)

2. Results

3. Discussion

1-3 consists of main text.

Online Methods. Stand alone methodology, do not count as main text.



Depending on article types, requirements for length are different. Common article types: article, comments, analysis, correspondence, reviews, etc.



*Public Library of Science One*, or PLoSONE, 







The co-reviewers compile one joint report.

How to submit a co-review
The established referee and ECR will have separate accounts in our online system:

- The established <span style='color:#00CC66'>referee submits the joint review</span>.

- The ECR only pastes the following statement without any modification in the ‘Comments to the Authors’ section: 

“I co-reviewed this manuscript with one of the reviewers who provided the listed reports. This is part of the *Nature Communications* initiative to facilitate training in peer review and to provide appropriate recognition for Early Career Researchers who co-review manuscripts.”



Need to answer the following questions in the process of review:

- What are the noteworthy results?
- Will the work be of significance to the field and related fields? How does it compare to the established literature? If the work is not original, please provide relevant references.
- Does the work support the conclusions and claims, or is additional evidence needed?
- Are there any flaws in the data analysis, interpretation and conclusions? Do these prohibit publication or require revision?
- Is the methodology sound? Does the work meet the expected standards in your field?
- Is there enough detail provided in the methods for the work to be reproduced?
