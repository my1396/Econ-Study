## Build the document

You can define several compiling toolchains to build LaTeX projects using [**LaTeX recipes**](https://github.com/James-Yu/latex-workshop/wiki/Compile#latex-recipes) and then call the command *Build with recipe* to choose the appropriate toolchain for actually building the project. Alternatively, you can directly select the appropriate recipe from the *TeX* badge <i class="fa-brands fa-tex" style="font-size: 1.5em"></i>.

Below are some commonly used examples:

```json
"latex-workshop.latex.recipes": [
  {
    "name": "latexmk",
    "tools": [
      "latexmk"
    ]
  },
  {
    "name": "pdflatex -> bibtex -> pdflatex * 2",
    "tools": [
      "pdflatex",
      "bibtex",
      "pdflatex",
      "pdflatex"
    ]
  }
]
```

-   The first one simply relies on the `latexmk` command. This is the **default** recipe to use when building a project.

-   The second one run the following sequence of commands `pdflatex` → `bibtex` → `pdflatex` → `pdflatex`.

-   Many of my projects use <span style="color: #008B45;">`xelatex`</span> instead of `pdflatex` to support Unicode characters and OpenType fonts. The recipe is similar to the second one, but it uses `xelatex` instead of `pdflatex`.

You can change the default recipe by setting the [`latex-workshop.latex.recipe.default`](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Compile#latex-workshoplatexrecipedefault). Recipes are referred to by their names as defined in `latex-workshop.latex.recipes`. Note there are two special values:

-   `"first"`: Use the first recipe defined in [`latex-workshop.latex.recipes`](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Compile#latex-recipes).
-   `"lastUsed"`: Use the last used recipe by the command *LaTeX Workshop: 
    
    Build with recipe*. This is useful when you have multiple recipes defined and you want to use the last one you used without having to select it again.

```json
// set the default recipe to the last used one
"latex-workshop.latex.recipe.default": "lastUsed"
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## View PDF

- **Forward/Direct synctex** (source to pdf) can either be activated by selecting 'Navigate, select, and edit' > 'SyncTeX from cursor' in the side bar, or by the shortcut `cmd`+`option`+`j` (on Mac).
  
    ```json
    // enable 
    "latex-workshop.synctex.afterBuild.enabled": true
    ```

    The setting syncs PDF with cursor position after compiling., defaults to `false`.

- **Backward/Reverse** synctex (pdf to source) is activated by pointing at the relevant element of the pdf preview. When using the internal viewer, the default keybinding to point at an element in the pdf preview is `cmd+click`. It can be changed to `double-click` using the setting [`latex-workshop.view.pdf.internal.synctex.keybinding`](https://github.com/James-Yu/latex-workshop/wiki/View#latex-workshopviewpdfinternalsynctexkeybinding).
  
  ```json
  "latex-workshop.view.pdf.internal.synctex.keybinding": "double-click"
  ```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Output Directory

By default, LaTeX builds with LaTeX Workshop puts output files in the directory containing your `.tex` file. This quickly creates a cluttered mess, due to the numerous auxiliary files generated by the LaTeX build process. To avoid clutter and allow for build files to be quickly deleted, change the out directory. I use the following setting:

```json
"latex-workshop.latex.outDir": "%DIR%/out_dir",
```

After changing `"latex-workshop.latex.outDir"`, LaTeX Workshop's `"Clean up auxiliary files"` command no longer deletes auxiliary files unless you also change this setting:

```json
"latex-workshop.latex.clean.subfolder.enabled": true,
```

(Note: The "Clean up auxiliary files" command misses some file types, so for a full clean you should just delete all of the files in the folder manually.)

## Overleaf Integration

Overleaf Workshop Extension: <https://github.com/iamhyc/overleaf-workshop>

**Log in with Cookies**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamhyc/Overleaf-Workshop/master/docs/assets/demo01-login.gif" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

1. Find Overleaf cookies:

   <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1GMargv1kBL1PgZEeZrn31QZQcDoY-_vE&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

   Go to [Overleaf homepage](https://www.overleaf.com/project) in Chrome > Open the browser developer tools (F12), go to <span class="env-green">"Network"</span> tab > In the Filter field, type "project" > Click the project under "Name" column > Go to <span class="env-green">"Headers"</span> tab > Scroll down to "Request Headers" section > Copy the value of <span class="env-green">"Cookie"</span>.

2. In VS code:

   Go to the Overleaf Workshop extension, click "log in with cookies", paste the cookies you copied from the browser, and click "Log in".

When the login is successful, you will see your Overleaf projects listed in the extension sidebar. And you will see the server status at the bottom left corner of VS Code.

**Highlight features:**

- Sync with Overleaf Cloud
  
  User cursor indicator will show your position.

- Chat with Collaborators (copy line reference)

- **On-the-fly Compiling and Previewing**

  Real-time PDF preview as you type.

  - Cmd + Option + B (on macOS) to compile, and
  - Cmd + Option + V to preview 

  The [compiling](https://github.com/overleaf-workshop/Overleaf-Workshop/blob/master/docs/wiki.md#compile-the-project) is done on Overleaf servers. The pdf output together with all auxiliary files will be in a folder named `/.output/` in your project.
  
  Your lock latex compiler, such as Latex Workshop, <span class="env-orange">won't</span> work here.

**Caveats:**

- Do <span class="env-orange">NOT</span> use the Overleaf Workshop "Open Projects Locally" feature. 
  
  ❗️ Using a local version leads to major issues, including edit conflicts and data loss. See this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/iamhyc/Overleaf-Workshop/issues/180).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overleaf pdf viewer supports three **themes**: `default` (white), `light` (warm yellow, easy on eyes 👍), and `dark`. You can change the theme via clicking the theme button (the square) on the title bar in the Overleaf PDF viewer.  
P.S. If you cannot see the theme button, please make sure the PDF viewer is wide enough.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SyncTeX and Reverse SyncTeX**

The SyncTeX and Reverse SyncTeX are supported in the Overleaf PDF viewer.

-   **SyncTeX, Jump to PDF**: put your cursor in the expected position in the document editor, then press `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`J` to jump to the corresponding position in the PDF.
    
    On Mac, use `Cmd`+`Option`+`J`.

-   **Reverse SyncTeX, Jump to Code**: double click on the text on PDF to jump to the corresponding position in the editor.


Q: Editor stops responding when compiling tex for preview.   
A: Disable auto build on save. This way, you can have a smooth editing experience and only compile when you need to preview. Use `⌥`+`⌘`+`B` to compile when needed.

```json
"overleaf-workshop.compileOnSave.enabled": false
```
