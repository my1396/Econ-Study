### Bompeng Toll

If the Token is not read when passing, the Customer is responsible for the toll incurred on the basis of photographing the number plate when passing the toll station. For vehicles without a valid Agreement, the Operator will demand a toll fee directly from the person registered as the vehicle's owner. 

The customer is responsible for removing the vehicle and thereby deactivating the Chip from the Agreement when selling or disposing of the vehicle.

If you change the chip issuer, you need to terminate the previous aggrement by yourself. The AutoPass system is updated within 24 hours after a new chip aggreement has been entered into.

用 AutoPASS brikke 打8折

**Time rule**: You only pay for one passage if the same vehicle/tag passes several toll stations within 60 mins.

**Monthly cap**: Charge maximum 80 passes per calendar month per vehicle associated with the AutoPASS. 



Where to put the tag (Feste bombrikken)

The bomb chip must be fixed at the top of the windscreen, to the right of the mirror, so that it does not obstruct the driver's view. Make sure it is not hidden behind windscreen wipers or similar.

前挡风玻璃顶部，后视镜的右边。确保不被雨刷挡住。



How to attach the toll tag 

1. Clean the windscreen where the new toll tag is to be attached. 
2. Remove the cover paper on one side of the Velcro and attach it to the marked area on the toll tag.  
3. Remove the cover paper on the other side of the Velcro, and press the chip against the windshield for 10 seconds.

> You pay the <u>traffic insurance fee</u> to your insurance company, together with the insurance on your car.
>
> The annual fee was changed to a traffic insurance fee in 2018. It is mandatory to have valid insurance for all registered vehicles. If you do not pay insurance and the traffic insurance fee (annual fee) for your vehicle, you will be charged for each day the vehicle is uninsured.
>
> If you have questions about the traffic insurance fee (annual fee), contact your insurance company. You can also read more about traffic insurance tax on the Traffic Insurance Association's website.

### Digital driving licence

Make your driving licence available on your mobile phone, and leave your physical licence at home when you drive in Norway.

> A digital driving licence is valid as proof of identity if you are stopped for inspection along the road. You should not expect that it will be accepted as proof of identity in other situations.
>
> If you use your digital driving licence when you are driving, you must ensure that you have enough battery life on your mobile phone to last throughout your drive, and the screen must be readable.

If you are going **abroad**, you still need to bring your physical driving licence.
