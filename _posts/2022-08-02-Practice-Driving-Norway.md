### Bompeng Toll

If the Token is not read when passing, the Customer is responsible for the toll incurred on the basis of photographing the number plate when passing the toll station. For vehicles without a valid Agreement, the Operator will demand a toll fee directly from the person registered as the vehicle's owner. 

The customer is responsible for removing the vehicle and thereby deactivating the Chip from the Agreement when selling or disposing of the vehicle.

If you change the chip issuer, you need to terminate the previous aggrement by yourself. The AutoPass system is updated within 24 hours after a new chip aggreement has been entered into.

用 AutoPASS brikke 打8折

**Time rule**: You only pay for one passage if the same vehicle/tag passes several toll stations within 60 mins.

**Monthly cap**: Charge maximum 80 passes per calendar month per vehicle associated with the AutoPASS. 



Where to put the tag

The bomb chip must be fixed at the top of the windscreen, to the right of the mirror, so that it does not obstruct the driver's view.



How to attach the toll tag 

1. Clean the windscreen where the new toll tag is to be attached. 
2. Remove the cover paper on one side of the Velcro and attach it to the marked area on the toll tag.  
3. Remove the cover paper on the other side of the Velcro, and press the chip against the windshield for 10 seconds.
