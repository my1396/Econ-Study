### **Tables**

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each column’s header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column.

Cell widths can vary, just use different relative length of hyphens.

```markdown
| Syntax | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text |
```



You can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon (`:`) to the left, right, or on both side of the hyphens within the header row.



### **Bullet list**

You can make a bulleted list by starting each line with a `-` or `*` or `+` character followed by a space. You can make a numbered list by starting each line with a `1.` followed by a space.

Markdown need an <span style='color:#32CD32'>**Empty line**</span> before a list.

` This will not work`

`* Item 1`

`* Item 1`

`* Item 1`



You can make a nested section of a list by **adding two spaces** before the bullet or number character.

- four spaces or one tab work before the bullet too.
- It is possible to add one blank line between different levels to increase readability.

```markdown
* unordered list
    + sub-item 1 
    + sub-item 2 
        - sub-sub-item 1
```

* unordered list
    + sub-item 1 
    + sub-item 2 
        - sub-sub-item 1

- You can still indent a paragraph even if you don't need a new bullet point. The indentation indicates that this paragraph belongs to the preceeding point.

  - You can also nest other elements like blockquotes or code blocks.

  ```markdown
  1. Ingredients
  
      - spaghetti
      - marinara sauce
      - salt
  
  2. Cooking
  
     Bring water to boil, add a pinch of salt and spaghetti. Cook until pasta is **tender**.
  
  3. Serve
  
     Drain the pasta on a plate. Add heated sauce. 
  
     > No man is lonely eating spaghetti; it requires so much attention.
  
     Bon appetit!
  ```

  1. Ingredients

     - spaghetti
     - marinara sauce
     - salt

  2. Cooking

     Bring water to boil, add a pinch of salt and spaghetti. Cook until pasta is **tender**.

  3. Serve

     Drain the pasta on a plate. Add heated sauce. 

     > No man is lonely eating spaghetti; it requires so much attention.

     Bon appetit!

  

- If list items are separated by blank lines, Markdown will wrap the items in `<p>` tags in the HTML output. 





**Backquotes**

To create a blockquote, start a line with greater than `>` followed by an optional space.

- To keep the quote in one block, blank lines inside the quote must contain the `>` character.







Reference-style links use a second set of square brackets `[text][url]`, inside which you place a lable of your choosing to identify the link.

```markdown
This is an example of referenc link: **[text][id]**.
```

This is an example of referenc link: **[text][id]**.



**Link definition**

The link definition can be placed anywhere after a blank line, but is generally near the bottom. You can also put them immediately after each paragraph in which they’re used.

Definition identifiers may consist of letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation. They are not case sensitive.

Then, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like this, on a line by itself:

```markdown
[id]: http://example.com/  "Optional Title Here"
```



The *implicit link name* shortcut allows you to omit the name of the link, in which case the link text itself is used as the name. Just use an empty set of square brackets — e.g., to link the word “Google” to the google.com web site, you could simply write:

```
[Google][]
```

And then define the link:

```
[Google]: http://google.com/
```

- Link names may contain spaces.

The point of reference-style links is not that they’re easier to write. The point is that with reference-style links, your document source is vastly more readable.



| Format       | Quoted by                     |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| bold         | `**text**` (**text**)         |
| italic       | `*text*` or `_text_` (*text*) |
| stikethrough | `~~text~~` (~~text~~)         |
