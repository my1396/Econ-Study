Jekyll converts markdown files to html; helps to generate blogs in a minimalistic style. This blog provides a quick start for installation, configuration, and simple usage.

### Installation

Before you can use Jekyll to create a GitHub Pages site, you must install Jekyll and Git. Follow the instruction in the websites below:

<https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll>

<https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/>



Which **shell** am I using?

Starting with macOS Catalina (10.15), Apple set the default [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) to the [Z shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) (zsh). In previous macOS versions, the default was [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)). 

- In `zsh`, the configuration file is `~/.zshrc`. 

- In `bash`, it’s `~/.bash_profile`. 

Every time you make changes with the configuration file

- run `source ~/.bash_profile` if you have `bash`. [✘]

- run `source ~/.zshrc` if the shell is `zsh`. [✔]



After having installed ruby, run `ruby -v` to check ruby version.



A `Gemfile` is a list of gems used by your site. Every Jekyll site has a Gemfile in the main folder. 

- Create a `Gemfile` in the root. The file should be called ‘Gemfile’ and should *not* have any extension. You can create a Gemfile with Bundler and then add the `jekyll` gem:

  ```bash
  bundle init
  bundle add jekyll
  ```

- Manage plugins

  1. add plugins to your `Gemfile`

     ```bash
     source 'https://rubygems.org'
     
     gem 'jekyll'
     
     group :jekyll_plugins do
       gem 'jekyll-sitemap'
       gem 'jekyll-feed'
       gem 'jekyll-seo-tag'
     end
     ```

  2. add plugins to `_config.yml`

     ```bash
     plugins:
       - jekyll-feed
       - jekyll-sitemap
       - jekyll-seo-tag
     ```

  3. install them by running `bundle update`



Gemfile syntax

- `~>` Pessimistically greater than or equal to

```ruby
gem "devise", "~> 3.1" # same as >= 3.1.0 and < 4.0.0
```





Q: What is a `Gemfile.lock`?

A: Gemfile.lock file contains all the information about the gems that are currently installed. This file is created automatically after we run the `bundle install` command. A `Gemfile.lock` has a list of the exact versions of the gems required for the application.



[`Bundler`](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler) is a gem that installs all gems in your `Gemfile`. Gem manager. Commands start with `bundle <>`.

- Install Bundler using `gem install bundler`. You only need to install it *once*, not every time you create a new Jekyll project.

- To <span style='color:#32CD32'>install gems in your Gemfile using Bundler and serve the website</span>, run the following in the directory that has the Gemfile:

  ``` bash
  bundle install # install gem dependencies for the project
  bundle exec jekyll serve # serve the website, run the site locally
  ```

  Now you can navigate to `http://localhost:4000` to preview your site.

  Jekyll rebuilds automatically after each change.

- All of the normal Jekyll commands are available to you, but you should prefix them with `bundle exec` so that Bundler runs the version of Jekyll that is installed in your project folder.

- `bundle add webrick` Add gem to the Gemfile and run bundle install.

- help page `bundle add --help`

### Jekyll file structure

Workflow of software develoment:

coding $\rightarrow$ build $\rightarrow$ deploy $\rightarrow$ test $\rightarrow$ release




**Deploying**

Deploying is taking website content and <span style='color:#32CD32'>publishing it to the Internet</span>.  Technically speaking, it is the process of compiling, or building, your code and hosting the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML on a web server. After deployment, you will always have your live website, which is called the <span style='color:#32CD32'>live environment or production environment</span>.

**Development**

If you want the ability to make changes without these affecting your live website, then you can add additional environments. These environments are called <span style='color:#32CD32'>development environments or deployment</span> environments.

|-- contact.html # => http://example.com/contact.html
```



- `_config.yml` \
  Configuration file, put in the root directory of your site.

  - set global variables; configure plugins; 

- `index.md` \
  The index page of your website can be a `index.md` file or a `README.md` file. If both exists the `index.md` file has priority.

- `_includes` \
  Contains snippets of code that can be inserted in multiple layouts within the same theme-gem.

  页面的共有部分，可以存储成一个单独的文件。这样设计可以方便以后的维护。而这个单独的公用文件就存放在`_includes`里面。这里面的公用文件，可以被`_layouts`和`_post`目录下面的文件嵌入。其嵌入方法，采用的是Liquid标签实现。比如：`{\% include file.ext \%}`，就指在文件中嵌入公用文件`_includes/file.ext`中的内容。

  `_includes`包括的内容比如：

  - `head.html` — Code-block that defines the `<head></head>` in *default* layout.
  - `custom-head.html` — Placeholder to allow users to add more metadata to `<head />`.
  - `header.html` — Defines the site's main header section. By default, pages with a defined `title` attribute will have links displayed here.
  - `footer.html` — Defines the site's footer section.
  - `google-analytics.html` — Inserts Google Analytics module (active only in production environment).
  - `disqus_comments.html` — Code to markup disqus comment box.
  - `social.html` — Renders social-media icons based on the `minima:social_links` data in the config file.
  - `social-item.html` — Template to render individual list-item containing graphic link to configured social-profile.
  - `social-links/*.svg` — SVG markup components of supported social-icons.

- `_layouts` Files in the `_layouts/` directory can be used as page **templates**.

  - All the repeating code on our site like the header, footer and navigation are typically in a layout.

- `assets` put your <span style='color:#32CD32'>custorm css</span> or <span style='color:#32CD32'>javascript files</span> here. 

  - I put my custom css in `/assets/css/style.scss`.

- `_sass` These are sass partials that can be imported into your `main.scss` which will then be processed into a single <span style='color:#32CD32'>stylesheet</span> `main.css` that defines the styles to be used by your site. 

  - Jekyll provides built-in support for [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and can work with [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/) via a Ruby gem. In order to use them, you must first create a file with the proper extension name (one of `.sass`, `.scss`, or `.coffee`) and **start the file with two lines of triple dashes**, not need to write front matter, like this:

    ```css
    ---
    ---
    
    // start content
    .my-definition
      font-size: 1.2em
    ```

    Jekyll treats these files the same as a regular page, in that the output file will be placed in the same directory that it came from. For instance, if you have a file named `css/styles.scss` in your site’s source folder, Jekyll will process it and put it in your site’s destination folder under `css/styles.css`.

- `_site` 这个目录，是jekyll运行之后生成的。存放着整个网站的最终静态页面。其中的内容，不用去关心。

- Pages are the most basic building block for content. 

  - The simplest way of adding a page is to add an HTML file in the *root* directory with a suitable filename. You can also write a page in Markdown using a `.md` extension and front matter which converts to HTML on build. For a site with a homepage, an about page, and a contact page, here’s what the root directory and associated URLs might look like:

    ```bash
    .
    ├── about.md    # => http://example.com/about.html
    ├── contact.html  # => http://example.com/contact.html
    └── index.html    # => http://example.com/
    ```

  - `index.html` contents in this file will show on the home page.

### Categories or Tags

The hallmark difference between categories and tags is that categories of a post may be incorporated into [the generated URL](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/#global)for the post, while tags cannot be.

1. add `category` variable in the front matter of each post.

   ```bash
   category: study
   categories: [life, drive]
   tag: study
   tags: [life, drive]
   ```

2. creating a category page.
   Using the `category` frontmatter variable, we can make a categories page called `categories.md` in the `_pages` directory where you can categorize and list each post by its category like so.

### Build Jekyll locally

This allows you to use plugins not supported by Github Pages.

Referencec: 

- <https://scaomath.github.io/blog/custom-plugins-jekyll-github/>
- <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site>

Github Pages only supports certain plugins. 



Two ways to build Jekyll websites:

1. **Build with GitHub Pages**

   In one sentence:  write a*<span style='color:#32CD32'> GitHub Actions</span>* workflow to publish your site.

   pros: simpler to get a site set up; don't need to manage branches;

   cons: restricted whitelisted plugins and themes can be used.

   GitHub now provides you with the option to use their in-house CI/CD product named GitHub Actions to *build and deploy (host)* your Jekyll site with complete control over the build environment and gemset.

   - Advantages of using `GitHub Actions`: 
     - can specify any Jekyll version instead of using the classic GitHub Pages-provided version at `3.9.3`; 
     
       `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml`:
     
       ```yml
       with:
         ruby-version: '3.2.2'
       ```
     
     - can use any Jekyll plugins  irrespective of them being whitelisted by GitHub, including any `*.rb` files placed in the `_plugins` directory of your site; 
     
     - while using a custom theme is possible without Actions, it is now possible to use themes depending on features introduced in newer versions of Jekyll.

2. **Build locally** and push the build directory contents to the `gh-pages` branch on your repository.

   **Publishing from a branch**.

   pros: flexible, full control of your website contents

   cons: have to mange branches; one `master` branch containing build html files and one `source` branch to manage all source files.



If we want to use a custom plugin or a newer version of Jekyll, for example, the Jekyll scholar plugin page to manage `.bib` files used in this [research page](https://scaomath.github.io/research/),

```css
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-scholar'
```

We need to build the `_site` locally in a branch other than `master` or `gh-pages`, and then sync and merge ONLY the <span style='color:#32CD32'>built html files</span> to either of these two branches.


1. We need to have a `master` branch, and a `source` branch (any name would do `draft`, `working`, etc). 

   - `master` is where GitHub pages are deployed;  It only include the `_site` directory.
   - `source` is where we work on writing the posts, css, js, etc. `source` has the entire jekyll project.
   - Note: It is recommended to change your default branch to `source`. Optionally, you can make the `source` branch protected to prevent it from being accidently deleted or overriden.

2. Make changes and build locally in `source` branch. This will create `_site` folder.  `_site` folder (where the site is built into) should be in the `.gitignore`.

3. Navigate to `master` branch, 

   1. copy files in `_site` folder to the root folder. 
   2. create  `.nojekyll` in the `master` branch. `.nojekyll` tells the gh-pages that there is no need to build.
   3. Meanwhile, in the `_config.yml` of the `source` branch, under the `include` key, we need to add `- .nojekyll`.



### Troubleshooting

Issue: Faild in Ubuntu-24.04-x64 runner when trying to deploy to GitHub Pages.

> Error: The current runner (ubuntu-24.04-x64) was detected as self-hosted because the platform does not match a GitHub-hosted runner image (or that image is deprecated and no longer supported).
>
> In such a case, you should install Ruby in the $RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE yourself, for example using https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build
>
> You can take inspiration from this workflow for more details: https://github.com/ruby/ruby-builder/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml
>
> $ ruby-build 3.1.4 /opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/3.1.4/x64
>
> Once that completes successfully, mark it as complete with:
>
> $ touch /opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/3.1.4/x64.complete
>
> It is your responsibility to ensure installing Ruby like that is not done in parallel.

Fix: Your workflow is using an older version. Need to update workflow.

I found my solutions [here](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/595#issue-2296094094).

Old workflow:

```ruby
uses: ruby/setup-ruby@8575951200e472d5f2d95c625da0c7bec8217c42 # v1.161.0
```

New workflow:

```ruby
uses: ruby/setup-ruby@086ffb1a2090c870a3f881cc91ea83aa4243d408 # v1.195.0
```

1. I compared my `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml` with [this script](https://github.com/0nyr/onyr-website/blob/main/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml), making sure my actions versions are consistent. 
2. I also commented out line 39.

### Themes

[Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)

stylesheets `css`: <https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/master/_sass/minimal-mistakes>



[Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)



**How to use custom css with Jekyll minima theme**

1. First need to find the right `css` file path to overrule.

   ```bash
   grep "stylesheet.*css" _site/index.html
   ```

   In my case I got

   ```bath
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/Econ-Study/assets/css/style.css"><link type="application/atom+xml" rel="alternate" href="http://localhost:4000/Econ-Study/feed.xml" title="Personal Notes" />
   ```

   Therefore, I need to make changes to `/assets/css/style.css`.



2. Need to do proper style inheritance. Source the active theme using `@import "minima"`.  Below this header, you can add additional CSS rules as you like.

   ```css
   ---
   # Only the main Sass file needs front matter (the dashes are enough)
   ---
   
   @import
     "minima/skins/{{ site.minima.skin | default: 'classic' }}",
     "minima/initialize";
   ```



**How to use `js` in Jekyll**

`js` script allows you to define some computer-customer interactions. For instance, when a user clicks a button, it will invoke some reactions.

- Load external `js` file in the page where you want to use the function. E.g.,

  ```html
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@0.14.2/dist/tf.min.js"></script>
  ```

- Load project `js` file using relative url

  ```html
  <script src="{{ site.baseurl}}/assets/js/script.js"></script>
  ```

- If you want the script available on every page, put the call in your `base.html` or `post.html`layout file, whichever your post template is. Every page that uses that default.html layout will then call the script. That layout file can be found at `_layouts/base.html`.

- If you just want it on your current page, just call it in your `some-page.md` markdown in the same way.

- If you only want to call it when it is live and DON'T want to call it while you are developing - like, for example, a google analytics script - then wrap the call in an if statement like this:

  {% highlight liquid %} {% raw %} {% if site.environment == "production" %}
  <script src="//localhost:port/liveload.js"></script>
  {% endif %} {% endraw %} {% endhighlight %}

- Note: Use Chrome $\rightarrow$ View $\rightarrow$ Developer $\rightarrow$ Inspect Element 

  - use `Application`  to check if the website load the `js` script at all.
  - use `Console` to check if there is any bug in your `js` code. If there is bug, `js` cannot run.
  - `http://127.0.0.1:4000/Econ-Study/assets/` check this url to see if you find your `js` files here.

**Example**: The following codes let you click the `Change text` button to change the text of the header from "Hello World" to "Have a nice day".

```html
<h1 id="myHeader">Hello World</h1>
<button onclick="displayResult()">Change text</button>
```

<h1 id="myHeader">Hello World</h1>

<button onclick="displayResult()">Change text</button>

- Sort by `update` if the object exists, otherwise sort by `date`. In other word, sort by`latest(date, update)`, whichever is the latest.
  
  Might need to use Ruby or JavaScript. \
  <http://sfriederichs.github.io/how-to/jekyll/2016/11/08/Nothing.html>
  
  First you must set the `update` field in the front-matter. If you decide not to set the field, then the `update` date falls back to the `date` field in the front-matter.
  
  A tutorial how to sort by `update` in *WordPress*:
  
  <https://www.namehero.com/blog/how-to-sort-posts-by-the-last-modified-date/>
  
  Add the following code to your theme’s `functions.ph`p file:
  
  ```javascript
  function sort_by_modified( $wp_query ) {
    global $pagenow;
    if ( ‘edit.php’ == $pagenow) {
      $wp_query->set( ‘orderby’, ‘modified’ );
      $wp_query->set( ‘order’, ‘ASC’ );
    }
  }
  add_filter(‘pre_get_posts’, ‘sort_by_modified’ );
  ```
  
  In *Jekyll*:
  
  ```css
  {% assign posts = site.posts | sort: 'update' | reverse %}
  ```
  
  But then you have to specify the `update` property for every post. `reverse` makes it sorted descending, i.e., from newest to oldest.
