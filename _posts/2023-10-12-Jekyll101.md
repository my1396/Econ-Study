Jekyll converts markdown files to html; helps to generate blogs in a minimalistic style. This blog provides a quick start for installation, configuration, and simple usage.

## Installation

Before you can use Jekyll to create a GitHub Pages site, you must install Jekyll and Git. 

**Follow the instruction in the websites below:**

<https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll>

<https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/>

> Note that must install ruby 3.x or lower. Higher versions such as 4.x have compatability issues with GitHub Pages.  
> Also the ruby version and gem versions must be compatible.

I personally started with ruby 2.7.2 (Summer 2024), then upgrade to ruby 3.1.6 later (Jan 2026). ✅

<span class="env-green">V3.x is much faster than V2.x</span>, saving about half the local build time used by V2.x. GitHub Actions are much faster too. Previously, GitHub Actions took about 2.5 to 4.5 minutes to build the site with ruby 2.7.2. Now with ruby 3.1.6, it only takes about 1.5 minute. 👍


Q: Which ruby version am I using?  
A: `cd` to your project folder and run `ruby --version` in the terminal.

```bash
cd "~/Documents/PhD Courses/Econ-Study"
ruby --version
```

Ruby version is specified in `.ruby-version` file in the root of your project. `chruby` will automatically switch to the ruby version specified in the file when you `cd` into the project folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is my installation steps using `ruby-install` and `chruby` on macOS$^{[1]}$:

$^{[1]}$ It takes some time (10 to 15 mins) to install ruby. Extra slow on an older Mac with slow internet connection. Be patient with the installation process.

```bash
# Install ruby 3.1.6 using ruby-install
HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP=1 ruby-install ruby 3.1.6

# Set ruby version using chruby and check ruby version
chruby 3.1.6 && ruby --version

# Source the system rc file (shell configuration file)
source ~/.zshrc

# Verify available ruby versions, the current version is marked with asterisk
chruby

# Install all gems in Gemfile.lock using Bundler
chruby 3.1.6 && ruby --version && bundle install

# Start jekyll server to serve the website locally
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Note that `&&` is used to chain commands together. The next command will only run if the previous command is successful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Which **shell** am I using?

Starting with macOS Catalina (10.15), Apple set the default [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) to the [Z shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) (zsh). In previous macOS versions, the default was [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)). 

- In `zsh`, the configuration file is `~/.zshrc`. 

- In `bash`, it’s `~/.bash_profile`. 

Every time you make changes with the configuration file

- run `source ~/.bash_profile` if you have `bash`. [Old Mac, Intel chip]

- run `source ~/.zshrc` if the shell is `zsh`. [New Mac, M chip]

## Managing Jekyll plugins with Bundler and Gemfile


A `Gemfile` is a list of gems used by your site. Every Jekyll site has a Gemfile in the main folder. 

- Create a `Gemfile` in the root. The file should be called ‘Gemfile’ and should *not* have any extension. You can create a Gemfile with Bundler and then add the `jekyll` gem:

  ```bash
  bundle init
  bundle add jekyll
  ```

- <span style='color:#00CC66'>**Manage plugins**</span>

  1. Append plugins to your `Gemfile`

     ```bash
     source 'https://rubygems.org'
     
     gem 'jekyll'
     
     group :jekyll_plugins do
       gem 'jekyll-sitemap'
       gem 'jekyll-feed'
       gem 'jekyll-seo-tag'
     end
     ```

  2. Add plugins to `_config.yml`

     ```bash
     plugins:
       - jekyll-feed
       - jekyll-sitemap
       - jekyll-seo-tag
     ```

  3. Install them by running `bundle update`



**Gemfile syntax**

- `~>` Pessimistically greater than or equal to

```ruby
gem "devise", "~> 3.1" # same as >= 3.1.0 and < 4.0.0
```





Q: What is a `Gemfile.lock`?

A: `Gemfile.lock` file contains all the information about the gems that are currently installed. This file is created automatically after we run the `bundle install` command. A `Gemfile.lock` has a list of the exact versions of the gems required for the application.



[`Bundler`](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler) is a gem that installs all gems in your `Gemfile`. Gem manager. Commands start with `bundle <>`.

- Install Bundler using `gem install bundler`. You only need to install it *once*, not every time you create a new Jekyll project.

- To <span style='color: #00CC66'>install gems in your Gemfile using Bundler and serve the website</span>, run the following in the directory that has the Gemfile:

  ``` bash
  bundle install # install gem dependencies for the project
  bundle exec jekyll serve # serve the website, run the site locally
  ```

  Now you can navigate to `http://localhost:4000` to preview your site.

  Jekyll rebuilds automatically after each change.

- All of the normal Jekyll commands are available to you, but you should prefix them with `bundle exec` so that Bundler runs the version of Jekyll that is installed in your project folder.

- `bundle add webrick` Add gem to the Gemfile and run bundle install.

- help page `bundle add --help`

## Jekyll file structure

Workflow of software development:

coding $\rightarrow$ build $\rightarrow$ deploy $\rightarrow$ test $\rightarrow$ release




**Deploying**

Deploying is taking website content and <span style='color: #00CC66'>publishing it to the Internet</span>.  Technically speaking, it is the process of compiling, or building, your code and hosting the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML on a web server. After deployment, you will always have your live website, which is called the <span style='color: #00CC66'>live environment or production environment</span>.

**Development**

If you want the ability to make changes without these affecting your live website, then you can add additional environments. These environments are called <span style='color: #00CC66'>development environments or deployment</span> environments.

|-- contact.html # => http://example.com/contact.html
```



- `_config.yml` \
  Configuration file, put in the root directory of your site.

  - set global variables; configure plugins; 

- `index.md` \
  The index page of your website can be a `index.md` file or a `README.md` file. If both exists the `index.md` file has priority.

- `_includes` \
  Contains snippets of code that can be inserted in multiple layouts within the same theme-gem.

  页面的共有部分，可以存储成一个单独的文件。这样设计可以方便以后的维护。而这个单独的公用文件就存放在`_includes`里面。这里面的公用文件，可以被`_layouts`和`_post`目录下面的文件嵌入。其嵌入方法，采用的是Liquid标签实现。比如：`{\% include file.ext \%}` (without backslashes)，就指在文件中嵌入公用文件`_includes/file.ext`中的内容。

  `_includes`包括的内容比如：

  - `head.html` — Code-block that defines the `<head></head>` in *default* layout.
  - `custom-head.html` — Placeholder to allow users to add more metadata to `<head />`.
  - `header.html` — Defines the site's main header section. By default, pages with a defined `title` attribute will have links displayed here.
  - `footer.html` — Defines the site's footer section.
  - `google-analytics.html` — Inserts Google Analytics module (active only in production environment).
  - `disqus_comments.html` — Code to markup disqus comment box.
  - `social.html` — Renders social-media icons based on the `minima:social_links` data in the config file.
  - `social-item.html` — Template to render individual list-item containing graphic link to configured social-profile.
  - `social-links/*.svg` — SVG markup components of supported social-icons.

- `_layouts` \
  Files in the `_layouts/` directory can be used as page **templates**. 网页模板
  
  All the repeating code on our site like the header, footer and navigation are typically in a layout.
  
  - `base.html` \
    equivalent to `default.html`. `content ` is a special variable, the value is the rendered content of the post or page being wrapped. 
    
    每一篇博客的模板。如果想要在每一个帖子下 load js script, css，在`base.html` 中改动。


    **Layout inheritance** is useful when you want to add something to an existing layout for a portion of documents on your site. The following templates are all based on `base.html`. You specify your original layout in front matter:
    
    ```markdown
    ---
    layout: default
    ---
    <-- make changes to suit your need for the new template type -- >
    ```
    
    - `home.html`     homepage typesetting, 网站主页模板。基于 `base.html` 可以做更多修改。
    
    - `post.html`     基于 `base.html` 可以做更多修改。比如这个 layout 用于文字较多的贴。
    
    - `page.html`     基于 `base.html` 可以做更多修改。比如这个 layout 用于代码或者公式较多的贴。可以加载不一样的 js script 和 css，不需要的就不用加载，以让网页内容加载速度更快。

- `assets` \
 put your <span style='color: #00CC66'>custorm css</span> or <span style='color: #00CC66'>javascript files</span> here. 

  - I put my custom css in `/assets/css/style.scss` for general setting and `/assets/css/syntax.css` for rouge syntax highlighting.

- `_sass` \
  These are sass partials that can be imported into your `main.scss` which will then be processed into a single <span style='color: #00CC66'>stylesheet</span> `main.css` that defines the styles to be used by your site. 

  - Jekyll provides built-in support for [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and can work with [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/) via a Ruby gem. In order to use them, you must first create a file with the proper extension name (one of `.sass`, `.scss`, or `.coffee`) and **start the file with two lines of triple dashes**, not need to write front matter, like this:

    ```css
    ---
    ---
    
    // start content
    .my-definition
      font-size: 1.2em
    ```

    Jekyll treats these files the same as a regular page, in that the output file will be placed in the same directory that it came from. For instance, if you have a file named `css/styles.scss` in your site’s source folder, Jekyll will process it and put it in your site’s destination folder under `css/styles.css`.

- `_site` 这个目录，是 Jekyll 运行之后生成的。存放着整个网站的最终静态页面。其中的内容，不用去关心。

- Pages are the most basic building block for content. 

  - The simplest way of adding a page is to add an HTML file in the *root* directory with a suitable filename. You can also write a page in Markdown using a `.md` extension and front matter which converts to HTML on build. For a site with a homepage, an about page, and a contact page, here’s what the root directory and associated URLs might look like:

    ```bash
    .
    ├── about.md      # => http://example.com/about.html
    ├── contact.html  # => http://example.com/contact.html
    └── index.html    # => http://example.com/
    ```

  - `index.html` contents in this file will show on the home page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Config file `_config.yml`


| Site Variable | Description                                                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`         | A site’s full URL including protocol, domain, and port (if applicable). |
| `baseurl`     | Name of sub-directory the site is served from e.g., `/Econ-Study`.      |

Improper use of `basesurl` will cause problems loading css, js, images, etc.

Here is the setting in my `_config.yml`:

```yml
url: "https://my1396.github.io"
baseurl: /Econ-Study
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Categories or Tags

The hallmark difference between categories and tags is that categories of a post may be incorporated into [the generated URL](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/#global)for the post, while tags cannot be.

1. add `category` variable in the front matter of each post.

   ```yml
   category: study
   categories: [life, drive]
   tag: study
   tags: [life, drive]
   ```

2. creating a category page.
   Using the `category` frontmatter variable, we can make a categories page called `categories.md` in the `_pages` directory where you can categorize and list each post by its category like so.

## Build Jekyll locally

This allows you to use plugins not supported by Github Pages.

References: 

- <https://scaomath.github.io/blog/custom-plugins-jekyll-github/>
- <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site>

Github Pages only supports certain plugins. 



Two ways to build Jekyll websites:

1. **Build with GitHub Pages**

   In one sentence:  write a*<span style='color: #00CC66'> GitHub Actions</span>* workflow to publish your site.

   GitHub Actions: <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/building-and-testing/building-and-testing-ruby>

   pros: simpler to get a site set up; don't need to manage branches;

   cons: restricted whitelisted plugins and themes can be used.

   GitHub now provides you with the option to use their in-house CI/CD product named GitHub Actions to *build and deploy (host)* your Jekyll site with complete control over the build environment and gemset.

   - Advantages of using `GitHub Actions`: 
     - can specify any Jekyll version instead of using the classic GitHub Pages-provided version at `3.9.3`; 
     
       `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml`:
     
       ```ruby
       steps:
       - name: Setup Ruby
         uses: ruby/setup-ruby@ec02537da5712d66d4d50a0f33b7eb52773b5ed1
         with:
           ruby-version: '3.1' # Not needed with a .ruby-version file
       - run: bundle install   # Install dependencies with Bundler
       - run: bundle exec rake
       ```
     
       The `setup-ruby` action takes a Ruby version as an input and configures that version on the runner.
     
       - Alternatively, you can check a `.ruby-version` file into the root of your repository and `setup-ruby` will use the version defined in that file.
     
       The `setup-ruby` action will automatically install `bundler` for you. 
     
       - The version is determined by your `gemfile.lock` file. 
       - If no version is present in your lockfile, then the latest compatible version will be installed.
     
     - can use any Jekyll plugins  irrespective of them being whitelisted by GitHub, including any `*.rb` files placed in the `_plugins` directory of your site; 
     
     - while using a custom theme is possible without Actions, it is now possible to use themes depending on features introduced in newer versions of Jekyll.

2. **Build locally** and push the build directory contents to the `gh-pages` branch on your repository.

   **Publishing from a branch**.

   pros: flexible, full control of your website contents

   cons: have to mange branches; one `master` branch containing build html files and one `source` branch to manage all source files.



If we want to use a custom plugin or a newer version of Jekyll, for example, the Jekyll scholar plugin page to manage `.bib` files used in this [research page](https://scaomath.github.io/research/),

```css
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-scholar'
```

We need to build the `_site` locally in a branch other than `master` or `gh-pages`, and then sync and merge ONLY the <span style='color: #00CC66'>built html files</span> to either of these two branches.


1. We need to have a `master` branch, and a `source` branch (any name would do `draft`, `working`, etc). 

   - `master` is where GitHub pages are deployed;  It only include the `_site` directory.
   - `source` is where we work on writing the posts, css, js, etc. `source` has the entire jekyll project.
   - Note: It is recommended to change your default branch to `source`. Optionally, you can make the `source` branch protected to prevent it from being accidently deleted or overriden.

2. Make changes and build locally in `source` branch. This will create `_site` folder.  `_site` folder (where the site is built into) should be in the `.gitignore`.

3. Navigate to `master` branch, 

   1. copy files in `_site` folder to the root folder. 
   2. create  `.nojekyll` in the `master` branch. `.nojekyll` tells the gh-pages that there is no need to build.
   3. Meanwhile, in the `_config.yml` of the `source` branch, under the `include` key, we need to add `- .nojekyll`.

## Code Highlighting

References:

- <https://jojozhuang.github.io/tutorial/jekyll-highlighting/>
- <https://notes.kargware.com/2019/10/04/Jekyll-Syntax-Highlighting/>

**[Add syntax highlighting to your Jekyll site with Rouge](https://bnhr.xyz/2017/03/25/add-syntax-highlighting-to-your-jekyll-site-with-rouge.html)**

[**Rouge**](https://github.com/jneen/rouge) (胭脂) is a pure-ruby syntax highlighter and has been the default highlighter for Jekyll since Jekyll 3 (replacing pygments). 

1. Make sure that the **kramdown** and **rouge** gems are installed.

   ```bash
   # check whether they are installed
   gem list
   # if not, install with
   gem install kramdown rouge
   ```

2. Edit your `_config.yml` settings.

   Add the following lines to your `_config.yml` file if they’re not there already.

   ```yml
   markdown: kramdown
   
   kramdown:
     input: GFM
     syntax_highlighter: rouge
   ```

   If that doesn’t work, you can try:

   ```yml
   markdown: kramdown
   highlighter: rouge
   ```

   By experience, my build times when using the first option are usually faster.

   Until now, rouge should have been working on your site, but you won't see the syntax highlighting as there is no css styling. The highlighting effect will appear once you add a css file following Step 3. 

3. Create a css file for the highlighting style you want.

   Rouge comes built-in with <span style='color:#00CC66'>`rougify`</span>, a command-line tool that converts a style theme to a css file.

   You can check what languages are supported by entering:

   ```bash
   rougify list
   ```

   You can see the available [rouge themes](https://github.com/mzlogin/rouge-themes) by entering:

   ```bash
   rougify help style
   ```

   ***base16, base16.dark, base16.monokai, base16.monokai.light, base16.solarized, base16.solarized.dark, colorful, github, gruvbox, gruvbox.light, molokai, monokai, monokai.sublime, thankful_eyes***

   Rouge theme preview page: <https://spsarolkar.github.io/rouge-theme-preview/>

   For example, if you want to use the github theme, you first create a css file in your css folder using rougify:

   ```bash
   rougify style github > assets/css/syntax.css
   ```

   The usual directory for the css files is **assets/css** while the usual name for the syntax highlighting css file is **`syntax.css`**. 

   Then don’t forget to include the stylesheet in your HTML template (usually within `<head></head>`). You can add the following line to your `_layouts/base.html` layout file:

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li>
    {% highlight liquid %}{% raw %} <link href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/css/syntax.css" rel="stylesheet">{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %} 

   <p style="margin-top: -6px"> will be rendered as:</p>

   {% highlight liquid %}{% raw %}
   <link href="/Econ-Study/assets/css/syntax.css" rel="stylesheet">{% endraw %}{% endhighlight %}

   <span style="display:block;">Note that <span style='color:#00CC66'>{% raw %} {{site.baseurl}}{% endraw %}</span> is added before <code>assets/css/syntax.css</code> as we need to specify the relative path to the stylesheet. Otherwise, the file cannot be found by Jekyll.</span>
</li>
</ul>


___

**Using `highlight.js`** 

Add `highlight.js` and `css` of the color scheme you want in the header page. Either you can add cdn url  or copy it in your project and give local path. This will find and all highlight the code inside of `<pre><code>` tags.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.15.8/styles/default.min.css">
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.15.8/highlight.min.js"></script>
<script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script>
```

- You can download the latest highlight.js and css from <https://highlightjs.org/download/>.

Table of `Supported Syntax`. See the full list [Jekyll - Syntax Highlighting, supported languages](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers).

Note that the names are case-sensitive, `sql` is recognizable, but not `SQL`.

## Troubleshooting

Issue: Faild in Ubuntu-24.04-x64 runner when trying to deploy to GitHub Pages.

```bash
Error: The current runner (ubuntu-24.04-x64) was detected as self-hosted because the platform does not match a GitHub-hosted runner image (or that image is deprecated and no longer supported).

In such a case, you should install Ruby in the $RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE yourself, for example using https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build

You can take inspiration from this workflow for more details: https://github.com/ruby/ruby-builder/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml

$ ruby-build 3.1.4 /opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/3.1.4/x64

Once that completes successfully, mark it as complete with:

$ touch /opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/3.1.4/x64.complete

It is your responsibility to ensure installing Ruby like that is not done in parallel.
```

Fix: Your workflow is using an older version. Need to update workflow.

I found my solutions [here](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby/issues/595#issue-2296094094).

Old workflow:

```ruby
uses: ruby/setup-ruby@8575951200e472d5f2d95c625da0c7bec8217c42 # v1.161.0
```

New workflow:

```ruby
uses: ruby/setup-ruby@086ffb1a2090c870a3f881cc91ea83aa4243d408 # v1.195.0
```

<div style="height:3px;"><br></div>


1. I compared my `.github/workflows/jekyll.yml` with [this script](https://github.com/0nyr/onyr-website/blob/main/.github/workflows/jekyll.yml), making sure my actions versions are consistent. 
2. I also commented out line 40 (`# ruby-version: '3.1' # Not needed with a .ruby-version file`).

**Bundler default gem URI dependency error**

```
bundler: failed to load command: jekyll (/home/runner/work/Econ-Study/Econ-Study/vendor/bundle/ruby/2.7.0/bin/jekyll)

/opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/2.7.2/x64/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/bundler-2.4.22/lib/bundler/runtime.rb:304:in `check_for_activated_spec!': 

You have already activated uri 0.10.0, but your Gemfile requires uri 0.12.0. Since uri is a default gem, you can either remove your dependency on it or try updating to a newer version of bundler that supports uri as a default gem. (Gem::LoadError)
```

Cause: The issue lies with Rubygems being outdated. If you update RubyGems, it will fix the issue.

Fix: Add the following line to `jekyll.yml` (in my case, I added to line 47 after Setup Pages). It installs the required version of the `uri` gem.

```ruby
- run: gem install uri
```

## Themes

[Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)

homepage: <https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/stylesheets/>

stylesheets `css`: <https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/tree/master/_sass/minimal-mistakes>



[Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)

[jtx-minima](https://github.com/xslim/jtx-minima/tree/master): user customized theme based on Minima



**How to use custom css with Jekyll minima theme**

1. First need to find the right `css` file path to overrule.

   ```bash
   grep "stylesheet.*css" _site/index.html
   ```

   In my case I got

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="/Econ-Study/assets/css/style.css"><link type="application/atom+xml" rel="alternate" href="http://localhost:4000/Econ-Study/feed.xml" title="Personal Notes" />
   ```

   Therefore, I need to make changes to `/assets/css/style.css`.



2. Need to do proper style inheritance. Source the active theme using `@import "minima"`.  Below this header, you can add additional CSS rules as you like.

   ```css
   ---
   # Only the main Sass file needs front matter (the dashes are enough)
   ---
   
   @import
     "minima/skins/{{ site.minima.skin | default: 'classic' }}",
     "minima/initialize";
   ```

## JavaScript

**How to use `js` in Jekyll**

`js` script allows you to define some computer-customer interactions. For instance, when a user clicks a button, it will invoke some reactions.

- Load external `js` file in the page where you want to use the function. E.g.,

  ```html
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@0.14.2/dist/tf.min.js"></script>
  ```

- Load project `js` file using relative url

  ```html
  {% raw  %}<script src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/js/script.js"></script>{% endraw %}
  ```

- If you want the script available on every page, put the call in your `base.html` or `post.html`layout file, whichever your post template is. Every page that uses that default.html layout will then call the script. That layout file can be found at `_layouts/base.html`.

- If you just want it on your current page, just call it in your `some-page.md` markdown in the same way.

- If you only want to call it when it is live and DON'T want to call it while you are developing - like, for example, a google analytics script - then wrap the call in an if statement like this:

  {% highlight liquid %} {% raw %} {% if site.environment == "production" %}
  <script src="//localhost:port/liveload.js"></script>
  {% endif %} {% endraw %} {% endhighlight %}

- Note: Use Chrome $\rightarrow$ View $\rightarrow$ Developer $\rightarrow$ Inspect Element 

  - use `Application`  to check if the website load the `js` script at all.
  - use `Console` to check if there is any bug in your `js` code. If there is bug, `js` cannot run.
  - `http://127.0.0.1:4000/Econ-Study/assets/` check this url to see if you find your `js` files here.



Same problem here: can't load js file to jekyll.

**Example**: The following codes let you click the `Change text` button to change the text of the header from "Hello World" to "Have a nice day".

```html
<h1 id="myHeader">Hello World</h1>
<button onclick="displayResult()">Change text</button>
```

<h1 id="myHeader">Hello World</h1>

<button onclick="displayResult()">Change text</button>

Q: What is a favicon?  
A: It is the little tiny icon on the left side of most of your your browser tabs.

Q: How to add a favicon to your website?   
A: Using the minima theme as an example, following the steps below:

1. Put your icon file in the Jekyll site folder,  e.g., `images/favicon.png`.

   You may see favicon files with the `.ico` extension. `.ico` files do a better job of rendering efficiently across most browsers, so default to this if you can.

2. Go to `_includes/head.html`, under `<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ "/assets/css/style.css" | relative_url }}">`, add the following line of code:

   ```html
   {% raw  %}<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/github2.png">{% endraw %}
   ```

   Up till now, everything is done, and if you run jekyll serve in terminal, you should be able to see the favicon appear by the name of your site.

   <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:502/format:webp/0*ojQY2iFqNMzk4Q3V.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:100%;" />

Favicon generator: <https://gauger.io/fonticon/>

Font Awesome icons: 

- <https://fontawesome.com/search> 

  - Download to local

    1. Search and open your required icon i.e [edit icon](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/edit?style=solid)

    2. Click on download `svg` as shown in given image.

       <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=160pEUlY9KV9uEsd4vOi3ecD_CgmAmBH5&sz=w1000" alt="" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />

    3. Now you can use this svg file in your website as favicon see [How to set favicon](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_link_sizes.asp).

  - Font Awesome CDN

    **Font Awesome** is hosted on a number of popular CDNs, enabling you to link directly to the individual SVG files. Just set the `href` URL of the `<link>` element to the desired SVG in the hosted **Font Awesome** library.

    ```html
    <head>
       <link rel=icon href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free@6/svgs/solid/rocket.svg>
    </head>
    ```

Q: How to add a file name to code blocks?  
A: Use html comment `<!-- code-filename: your_file_name.ext -->` before the code block.


{: data-filename="deploy.sh"}
```bash
echo ok
```

- Note you need to set up JavaScript accordingly to make it work.
- The tab is optional and appears only when a filename is provided.
- Copy-to-clipboard omits the filename directive line

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tips:**

- Vertial bar `|` in markdown is interpreted as a table column separator. To use it in text, escape it with a backslash `\|`.

- Sort by `update` if the object exists, otherwise sort by `date`. In other word, sort by`latest(date, update)`, whichever is the latest.
  
  Might need to use Ruby or JavaScript. \
  <http://sfriederichs.github.io/how-to/jekyll/2016/11/08/Nothing.html>
  
  First you must set the `update` field in the front-matter. If you decide not to set the field, then the `update` date falls back to the `date` field in the front-matter.
  
  A tutorial how to sort by `update` in *WordPress*:
  
  <https://www.namehero.com/blog/how-to-sort-posts-by-the-last-modified-date/>
  
  Add the following code to your theme’s `functions.php` file:
  
  ```javascript
  function sort_by_modified( $wp_query ) {
    global $pagenow;
    if ( 'edit.php' == $pagenow) {
      $wp_query->set( 'orderby', 'modified' );
      $wp_query->set( 'order', 'ASC' );
    }
  }
  add_filter('pre_get_posts', 'sort_by_modified' );
  ```
  
  In *Jekyll*:
  
  {% highlight liquid %} {% raw  %}  {% assign posts = site.posts | sort: 'update' | reverse %}  {% endraw %} {% endhighlight %} 
  
  But then you have to specify the `update` property for every post. `reverse` makes it sorted descending, i.e., from newest to oldest.
