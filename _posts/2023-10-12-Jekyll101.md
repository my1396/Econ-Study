Jekyll converts markdown files to html; helps to generate blogs in a minimalistic style. This blog provides a quick start for installation, configuration, and simple usage.

### Installation

Before you can use Jekyll to create a GitHub Pages site, you must install Jekyll and Git. Follow the instruction in the websites below:

<https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll>

<https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/>



Which **shell** I am using?

Starting with macOS Catalina (10.15), Apple set the default [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) to the [Z shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) (zsh). In previous macOS versions, the default was [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)). 

- In `zsh`, the configuration file is `~/.zshrc`. 

- In `bash`, it’s `~/.bash_profile`. 

Every time you make changes with the configuration file

- run `source ~/.bash_profile` if you have `bash`. [✘]

- run `source ~/.zshrc` if the shell is `zsh`. [✔]



After having installed ruby, run `ruby -v` to check ruby version.



A `Gemfile` is a list of gems used by your site. Every Jekyll site has a Gemfile in the main folder. 

- Create a `Gemfile` in the root. The file should be called ‘Gemfile’ and should *not* have any extension. You can create a Gemfile with Bundler and then add the `jekyll` gem:

  ```bash
  bundle init
  bundle add jekyll
  ```

- Manage plugins

  1. add plugins to your `Gemfile`

     ```bash
     source 'https://rubygems.org'
     
     gem 'jekyll'
     
     group :jekyll_plugins do
       gem 'jekyll-sitemap'
       gem 'jekyll-feed'
       gem 'jekyll-seo-tag'
     end
     ```

  2. add plugins to `_config.yml`

     ```bash
     plugins:
       - jekyll-feed
       - jekyll-sitemap
       - jekyll-seo-tag
     ```

  3. install them by running `bundle update`



[`Bundler`](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler) is a gem that installs all gems in your `Gemfile`. Gem manager. Commands start with `bundle <>`.

- Install Bundler using `gem install bundler`. You only need to install it *once*, not every time you create a new Jekyll project.

- To <span style='color:#32CD32'>install gems in your Gemfile using Bundler and serve the website</span>, run the following in the directory that has the Gemfile:

  ``` bash
  bundle install # install gem dependencies for the project
  bundle exec jekyll serve # serve the website, run the site locally
  ```

  Now you can navigate to `http://localhost:4000` to preview your site.

  Jekyll rebuilds automatically after each change.

- All of the normal Jekyll commands are available to you, but you should prefix them with `bundle exec` so that Bundler runs the version of Jekyll that is installed in your project folder.

- `bundle add webrick` Add gem to the Gemfile and run bundle install.

- help page `bundle add --help`

### Jekyll file structure

Workflow of software develoment

coding $\rightarrow$ build $\rightarrow$ deploy $\rightarrow$ test $\rightarrow$ release




**Deploying**

Deploying is taking website content and publishing it to the Internet.  Technically speaking, it is the process of compiling, or building, your code and hosting the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML on a web server.



<https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/>

<https://nicolas-van.github.io/easy-markdown-to-github-pages/>

```bash
.
|-- _config.yml
|-- _includes
|-- _layouts
|   |-- default.html
|   |-- post.html
|-- _posts
|   |-- 2007-10-29-why-every-programmer-should-play-nethack.textile
|   |-- 2009-04-26-barcamp-boston-4-roundup.textile
├── _sass
│   ├── _base.scss
│   └── _layout.scss
|-- _site
|-- index.html # => http://example.com/
|-- about.md # => http://example.com/about.html
|-- contact.html # => http://example.com/contact.html
```



- `_config.yml` configuration file, put in the root directory of your site.

  - set global variables; configure plugins; 

- `index.md`

  The index page of your website can be a `index.md` file or a `README.md` file. If both exists the `index.md` file has priority.

- `_includes` 

  Contains snippets of code that can be inserted in multiple layouts within the same theme-gem.

  页面的共有部分，可以存储成一个单独的文件。这样设计可以方便以后的维护。而这个单独的公用文件就存放在`_includes`里面。这里面的公用文件，可以被`_layouts`和`_post`目录下面的文件嵌入。其嵌入方法，采用的是Liquid标签实现。比如：`{\% include file.ext \%}`，就指在文件中嵌入公用文件`_includes/file.ext`中的内容。

  包括的内容比如：

  - `head.html` — Code-block that defines the `<head></head>` in *default* layout.
  - `custom-head.html` — Placeholder to allow users to add more metadata to `<head />`.
  - `header.html` — Defines the site's main header section. By default, pages with a defined `title` attribute will have links displayed here.
  - `footer.html` — Defines the site's footer section.
  - `google-analytics.html` — Inserts Google Analytics module (active only in production environment).
  - `disqus_comments.html` — Code to markup disqus comment box.
  - `social.html` — Renders social-media icons based on the `minima:social_links` data in the config file.
  - `social-item.html` — Template to render individual list-item containing graphic link to configured social-profile.
  - `social-links/*.svg` — SVG markup components of supported social-icons.

- `_layouts` Files in the `_layouts/` directory can be used as page **templates**.

  - All the repeating code on our site like the header, footer and navigation are typically in a layout.

- `assets` put your <span style='color:#32CD32'>custorm css</span> or <span style='color:#32CD32'>javascript files</span> here. 

  - I put my custom css in `/assets/css/style.scss`.

- `_sass` These are sass partials that can be imported into your `main.scss` which will then be processed into a single <span style='color:#32CD32'>stylesheet</span> `main.css` that defines the styles to be used by your site. 

  - Jekyll provides built-in support for [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and can work with [CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/) via a Ruby gem. In order to use them, you must first create a file with the proper extension name (one of `.sass`, `.scss`, or `.coffee`) and **start the file with two lines of triple dashes**, not need to write front matter, like this:

    ```css
    ---
    ---
    
    // start content
    .my-definition
      font-size: 1.2em
    ```

    Jekyll treats these files the same as a regular page, in that the output file will be placed in the same directory that it came from. For instance, if you have a file named `css/styles.scss` in your site’s source folder, Jekyll will process it and put it in your site’s destination folder under `css/styles.css`.

- `_site` 这个目录，是jekyll运行之后生成的。存放着整个网站的最终静态页面。其中的内容，不用去关心。

- Pages are the most basic building block for content. 

  - The simplest way of adding a page is to add an HTML file in the *root* directory with a suitable filename. You can also write a page in Markdown using a `.md` extension and front matter which converts to HTML on build. For a site with a homepage, an about page, and a contact page, here’s what the root directory and associated URLs might look like:

    ```bash
    .
    ├── about.md    # => http://example.com/about.html
    ├── contact.html  # => http://example.com/contact.html
    └── index.html    # => http://example.com/
    ```

  - `index.html` contents in this file will show on the home page.

### Categories or Tags

The hallmark difference between categories and tags is that categories of a post may be incorporated into [the generated URL](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/#global)for the post, while tags cannot be.

1. add `category` variable in the front matter of each post.

   ```bash
   category: study
   categories: [life, drive]
   tag: study
   tags: [life, drive]
   ```

2. creating a category page.

   Using the `category` frontmatter variable, we can make a categories page called `categories.md` in the `_pages` directory where you can categorize and list each post by its category like so.

### Build Jekyll locally

This allows you to use plugins not supported by Github Pages.

Reference: <https://scaomath.github.io/blog/custom-plugins-jekyll-github/>

Github Pages only supports certain plugins. 

If we want to use a custom plugin or a newer version of Jekyll, for example, the Jekyll scholar plugin page to manage `.bib` files used in this [research page](https://scaomath.github.io/research/),

```css
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem 'jekyll-scholar'
```

We need to build the `_site` locally in a branch other than `master` or `gh-pages`, and then sync and merge ONLY the built html files to either of these two branches.



1. We need to have a `master` branch, and a `source` branch (any name would do `draft`, `working`, etc). 

   - `master` is where GitHub pages are deployed;  It only include the `_site` directory.

   - `source` is where we work on writing the posts, css, js, etc. `source` has the entire jekyll project.
   - Note: It is recommended to change your default branch to `source`. Optionally, you can make the `source` branch protected to prevent it from being accidently deleted or overriden.

2. Make changes and build locally in `source` branch. This will create `_site` folder.  `_site` folder (where the site is built into) should be in the `.gitignore`.

3. Navigate to `master` branch, 

   1. copy files in `_site` folder to the root folder. 

   2. create  `.nojekyll` in the `master` branch. `.nojekyll` tells the gh-pages that there is no need to build.

   3. Meanwhile, in the `_config.yml` of the `source` branch, under the `include` key, we need to add `- .nojekyll`.
