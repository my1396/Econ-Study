Pressing `/` in Notion brings up a full menu of content blocks you can choose to insert. You can shortcut this further by pressing `/` and then typing what you want. 



How to center text: insert a block equation then use `\text{}`.



| Shortcut | Function                   |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| cmd + E  | turn text into inline code |



Add inline equations

- method 1: type 2 dollar signs, i.e., `$$`, followed by your eqn., then close with another 2 dollar signs.
- method 2: type `/inline` equation





Add block eqn: type `/math`

Add quote blocks: type `"` followed by `space` to create a quote block.
