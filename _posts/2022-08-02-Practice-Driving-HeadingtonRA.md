#####  **2. From Northern Bypass**

BRM video starts from 13:30

- Roundabout sign appears very early

  -   if you are going to Cowley/Headington, be preapred to move to the right lane when the long  white lines become short lines; you don't need to move over right away when you see the sign, just be prepared to do so; long white lines are hazard lines which you are not supposed to cross; short white lines are ok to cross to change lanes;

- You first see two speed limit signs left and right say 50m/h;

- then you see "Reduced Speed Now" sign, you reduce speed to 40m/h, NOT too slow, 30m/h would be outragously slow;

<img src="{{ site.baseurl}}/images/image-20221127085348670.png" alt="image-20221127085348670" style="zoom:50%;" />
