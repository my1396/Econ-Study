## Speech to Text

Whisper from OpenAI is a powerful tool for converting audio files to text. It supports multiple languages and can handle various audio formats.
Whisper recognizes 98 different languages, including Norwegian and English. You can either transcribe text in the same language or translate it into English.

Speech to text can be used to transcribe most types of audio and video files. The service can also be used to streamline the subtitling of video.

The quality of the automatic transcription with Whisper will vary, and the text should be reviewed and corrected manually. Both the sound quality of the recording itself and the language or dialect to be transcribed will affect the accuracy of the transcript.
