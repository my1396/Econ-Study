below £270: CN22 form

>   Customs forms are now mandatory for all gifts and goods sent to a country outside the UK, except when sending items from Northern Ireland to the EU.
>
>   For Business: The regulations on sending to the EU are changing. From 1 July 2021 items sold to EU destinations valuing €22 or less are no longer exempt from VAT.
>
>   For **gifts**: Just make sure the GIFT option is ticked in the content section of the customs form. All gifts under €45 are VAT exempt. And, for gifts over €45, any charges will be collected from the recipient on delivery as normal.
>
>   Customs forms need to be attached to the outside of your item with all relevant fields completed. You are responsible for ensuring a fully complete Customs Form is attached to your item. Any items with incomplete or absent customs forms are likely be returned to the sender so it's important you get it right.
