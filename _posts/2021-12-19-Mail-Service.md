>   Customs forms are now mandatory for all gifts and goods sent to a country outside the UK, except when sending items from Northern Ireland to the EU.
>
>   For Business: The regulations on sending to the EU are changing. From 1 July 2021 items sold to EU destinations valuing €22 or less are no longer exempt from VAT.
>
>   For **gifts**: Just make sure the GIFT option is ticked in the content section of the customs form. All gifts under €45 are VAT exempt. And, for gifts over €45, any charges will be collected from the recipient on delivery as normal.
>
>   Customs forms need to be attached to the outside of your item with all relevant fields completed. You are responsible for ensuring a fully complete Customs Form is attached to your item. Any items with incomplete or absent customs forms are likely be returned to the sender so it's important you get it right.

## Send Bike Within EU

**Service can be used**:

- Sendbike: <https://sendbike.com>
- <https://www.transglobalexpress.co.uk/send-bikes/>

Shippment fee: £120



**Resale Value**

原则是填非常低的价格，如£30，以避免交关税。否则收货时，收货人要交关税。后续可以退税，但过程费时费力。

This value is for customs purposes only and should reflect an estimated resale value for the contents of your box (not a replacement value), for example a toothbrush would have no resale value and a used shirt may be valued at a few pounds. Typically a bicycle will carry a resale value to customs of under £30.  Most countries including the UK & USA offer a generous tax and duty free allowance for returning residents, holiday makers and settlers who send unaccompanied boxes containing “Personal Clothing & Personal Effects”. 

Please be aware however, that there might be a extra customs admin fee of 30 euro to some EU countries due to Brexit.  

If you send new or commercial items import duties and taxes may be due as standard.  This declared value for customs purposes is unrelated to the amount which you may like to cover your bike against loss for, you may extend cover on your bike against loss up to £10,000.

We have all the personal item forms needed for customs most standard sites don't as they mostly send new items and we fill in the forms for you. Again first please box the bike and inform us of sizes then we can quote



**Ship to the UK**

A UK number is needed to confirm your booking as the courier can't ring international phone numbers due to how their systems are set up. If you don't have a personal number you can use the following options below  

-   Ask a friend or family member for their local number 
-   You may use the hotel or landlords phone number 
-   Your travel guide or travel agents number.
