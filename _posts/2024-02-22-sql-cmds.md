## String

`CHARINDEX(substring, string, start)`  searches for a substring in a string, and returns the position.

- `start` 	the postion where the search will start. The 1st position in string is 1.



`LEFT`, `RIGHT`, and `SUBSTRING`

- `LEFT(string, number_of_chars)` subset a number of characters from left
- `RIGHT(string, number_of_chars)` subset a number of characters from right
- `SUBSTRING(string, start, length)` subset from a middle position indexed at `start`



Subset before a symbol

- `LEFT(field_name, CHARINDEX('symbol needed', field_name) - 1)`

  ```sql
  -- extract from the left to the hypen symbol (`-`)
  SELECT  
  LEFT(identifier,CHARINDEX('-', identifier) - 1) AS identifier
  FROM table_4
  -- extract from the left to the space (` `)
  SELECT  
  LEFT(identifier,CHARINDEX(' ', identifier) - 1) AS identifier
  FROM table_5
  ```


Subset after a symbol

- `RIGHT(field_name, CHARINDEX('symbol needed', (REVERSE(field_name))) - 1)`

  use `REVERSE` to get the position starting from the right.



Wildcards

Use `LIKE pattern` to match a specific pattern, rather than one exact value.

| Wildcard character | Description                                                  | Example                                                      |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `%`                | Any string of zero or more characters.                       | `WHERE title LIKE '%computer%'` finds all book titles with the word `computer` anywhere in the book title. |
| `_`(underscore)    | Any single character.                                        | `WHERE au_fname LIKE '_ean'` finds all four-letter first names that end with `ean` (`Dean`, `Sean`, and so on). |
| `[ ]`              | Any single character within the specified range `[a-f]` or set `[abcdef]`. | `WHERE au_lname LIKE '[C-P]arsen'` finds author last names ending with `arsen` and starting with any single character between `C` and `P`, for example `Carsen`, `Larsen`, `Karsen`, and so on. In range searches, the characters included in the range may vary depending on the sorting rules of the collation. |
| `[^]`              | Any single character not within the specified range `[^a-f]` or set `[^abcdef]`. | `WHERE au_lname LIKE 'de[^l]%'` finds all author last names starting with `de` and where the following letter isn't `l`. |

- Escape a wildcard character: enclose with `[]`. 





Print column names

```sql
-- print all column names
SELECT * 
FROM sys.columns 
WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID('sym_v1.sym_coverage')
```
