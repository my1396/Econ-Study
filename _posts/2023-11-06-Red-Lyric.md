Song by Taylor Swift

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street \
<span style='color:666666'>爱上他 就仿佛驾驶玛莎拉蒂驶向一条不归路</span> \
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly \
Loving him is like trying to change your mind \
Once you're already flying through the free fall \
Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all \
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known \
Missing him was dark gray, all alone \
Forgetting him was like trying to know \
Somebody you never met \
But loving him was red \
Loving him was red \
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted \
Was right there in front of you \
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words \
To your old favorite song \
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword \
And realizing there's no right answer \
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out \
That love could be that strong \
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known \
Missing him was dark gray, all alone \
Forgetting him was like trying to know \
Somebody you never met \
But loving him was red \
Oh, red \
Burning red \
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes \
Tell myself it's time now gotta let go \
But moving on from him is impossible \
When I still see it all in my head \
In burning red \
Burning, it was red \
Oh, losing him was blue, like I'd never known \
Missing him was dark gray, all alone \
Forgetting him was like trying to know \
Somebody you never met \
'Cause loving him was red \
Yeah, yeah, red \
Burning red \
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head \
Comes back to me, burning red \
Yeah, yeah \
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
